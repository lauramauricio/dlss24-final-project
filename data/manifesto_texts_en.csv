The goal is clear for us Greens: we want to win additional seats in the National Council and Council of States and expand our influence. Because Switzerland needs more green policies. Green policies for the environment, for a sustainable economy and for social and global justice. The Greens are the fifth strongest party in Switzerland and have achieved a great deal in their 30-year history. Our issues have reached the heart of society. What once seemed utopian is now taken for granted: 30 km/h speed limits in residential areas, GMO-free agriculture and openness to diverse lifestyles and family forms. Without the Greens, there would be no energy transition, no maternity insurance, no more flexible retirement age, no modal shift. Without the Greens, Switzerland would be on armed missions in Afghanistan and would have procured 22 superfluous fighter planes. The Greens have shaped and advanced Switzerland as it is today by providing impetus and making political decisions. But we do not want to be satisfied with what we have achieved. Without our persistence, Switzerland will remain stuck halfway in energy or transport policy. Unlike other parties, we also stand by our convictions in the face of headwinds. Like the Greens in the canton of Valais, who were the only party to dare to vote yes to the new spatial planning law.prosperity today is often confused with wealth and unlimited growth. For us Greens, other values count. We want to safeguard scarce resources for future generations. And we are committed to a better quality of life in everyday life, healthy food and our unique landscapes. We also persistently pursue issues that are stuck halfway. With two green popular initiatives, for example, we want to push through the phase-out of nuclear energy and make the economy more environmentally friendly.unfortunately, Switzerland is moving at two speeds. Educational opportunities, wages, wealth and influence are distributed extremely unequally. Today there are ten times more millionaires than in 1980, and wealth is concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. We Greens cannot accept the social divide in society. We demand fair taxes, fair wages and sustainable safety nets so that all people can live in dignity. And we also want to give a voice to those who are not on the sunny side of life.The vote on February 9, 2014 shifted the political axes in Switzerland. A narrow majority of the population opted for the path of uncertainty and isolation. Switzerland's place in the world will be renegotiated in the next legislature. There are three options: Total isolation, globalization of profits or fair cooperation with other states. The Greens are committed to the constructive path of cooperation. We want fair rules for the economy based on human, social and environmental rights. This is the only way we can secure the global basis of life and give people in their countries and regions of origin a perspective.sustainability not only advances the global economy, but also the local economy. Thanks to innovation and intelligent technology, scarce resources can be conserved and waste avoided. Many green people work in their own companies and demonstrate that environmental protection, fair wages and family-friendly forms of work are also economically successful. Such companies create significantly more prosperity than corporations that focus purely on quantitative growth and high profits. Instead of location dumping, we rely on regional economic cycles and the economical use of raw materials and transportation. We do not want to burden our children with even more inherited burdens, and the Greens are the only party today that consistently combines environmental issues with social issues and fundamental liberal rights. One example is our popular initiative for sustainable food. The Fair Food Initiative not only aims to put healthy and organically produced food on the table, but also to strengthen fair working conditions in agriculture. Not only in Switzerland, but also in other countries. In this way, we can change the world with our fork, and a consistent policy can only thrive in independence. We Greens do not allow ourselves to be bought by the lobbies and banks that determine policy in Bern. All the more reason for us to work together with the population, with environmental associations, with creative artists and movements, with trade unions and environmentally conscious companies. We are concerned with the cause. That is why we work together with alliance partners. However, the Greens are also capable of taking initiatives and referendums and are committed to the concerns of the population in numerous communes and cantons in parliaments, governments and commissions. Fifty percent of all cantonal council seats are held by women and, together with the young Greens, we are managing the constant generational change. In line with the motto ""think globally - act globally"", we are also working with the ""Global Greens"" and our European sister parties to promote global climate protection and the energy and resource transition. Together, we are fighting against free trade agreements that seek to sacrifice human rights, animal welfare or public services on the altar of profits. Together, we are committed to tax-friendly financial and commodity markets, a humane asylum policy and global disarmament. If you vote green, you are voting for a network of committed people. If you vote green, you are voting for a Switzerland that has a future.Adele Thorens and Regula Rytz, Co-Presidents of the Swiss Greens",NA,NA

Where is our country heading, what kind of society do we want? The national-conservative forces want to seal off Switzerland, see migration as a problem and accept that war refugees drown in the Mediterranean. They question human rights and want to drive a wedge between the population and the institutions by dragging parliaments and governments, the courts, authorities and offices and partly also the schools and universities through the mud.There is an alternative to this national-conservative Switzerland. And here the SP, as the strongest force, wants to and must play a decisive role. We want an open, just and solidary Switzerland. We want a stable, close and reliable cooperation with Europe. We uphold our humanitarian tradition and defend human rights as an indispensable part of our law, which protects us all from arbitrariness and despotism. We fight for distributive justice in a time when wealth and income are distributed more and more unequally. And we are fighting to strengthen social welfare systems. Because they are the prerequisite for balance and peaceful coexistence in our society. We will be at the forefront of the discussions on opening up Switzerland, on the importance of our humanitarian tradition, on distributive justice and on safeguarding the social welfare systems, and we will fight to combine the forces that lead us in this direction. After all, it is our values and social democratic achievements that have ensured our country's success for decades.The confrontation between the Switzerland of openness and the Switzerland of fear will be defining in 2015. In addition, the SP will use the election year time and again to make its own tangible demands, which we discussed together and adopted on February 14 with our election platform - demands that will improve people's lives and coexistence in our society in a very concrete and targeted way.Christian Levrat",NA,NA

43811,201910,"However, adjustments are needed to secure the social security system in the long term.",504,NA
43811,201910,"The history of pension provision in Switzerland shows that it has often been defined along political lines, paying too little attention to economic facts.",504,NA
43811,201910,"As a result, financial bottlenecks have emerged that threaten sustainability for future generations.",504,NA
43811,201910,The three pillars highlighted in brief:,H,NA
43811,201910,The AHV is based on the pay-as-you-go system and serves to secure subsistence.,504,NA
43811,201910,"To a certain extent, it can be described as one of the largest solidarity works in Swiss history.",504,NA
43811,201910,"Occupational pension provision is caught between conversion rates, returns and life expectancy.",504,NA
43811,201910,Private pension provision can and must be decisively promoted.,504,NA
43811,201910,Challenges,H,NA
43811,201910,1st pillar: AHV,H,NA
43811,201910,"In addition to its function of providing for people's livelihoods, the AHV has a strong redistributive element.",504,NA
43811,201910,"Since higher incomes pay more contributions than would be needed to fund their pensions, and low incomes receive more benefits than their contributions generate, money flows from high to low incomes.",504,NA
43811,201910,The AHV is therefore one of the largest and most impressive works of solidarity in Switzerland.,504,NA
43811,201910,"When the AHV was enshrined in law in 1948, the average life expectancy was 66.4 years for men and 70.9 years for women. At that time, the retirement age was set at 65 for both sexes. By 2017, life expectancy had increased to 81.4 years for men and 85.4 years for women. The retirement age for women was lowered from 65 to 62 in two revisions and then raised again to 64 in 2005.",NA,NA
43811,201910,"By basing it on an absolute retirement age, demographic developments play a central role.",504,NA
43811,201910,An automatic link between retirement age and life expectancy is an ideal way to address this fact and depoliticize the retirement age issue.,504,NA
43811,201910,Pillar 2: Occupational pension plan,H,NA
43811,201910,The 2nd pillar is based on the funded method and includes pension fund benefits.,504,NA
43811,201910,Its purpose is to maintain the accustomed standard of living in a reasonable manner.,504,NA
43811,201910,The savings obligation for employed persons begins at the age of 25.,504,NA
43811,201910,"Here, too, demography in the form of higher life expectancy plays a decisive role, and the politically determined conversion rates lag behind this development.",504,NA
43811,201910,"At the same time, the aim is to achieve a minimum return, which is very difficult to achieve in the current market environment.",504,NA
43811,201910,And there are few signs that this market environment will improve markedly in the foreseeable future.,504,NA
43811,201910,"Here, for example, access to new investment opportunities can improve return opportunities without disproportionately increasing risks.",504,NA
43811,201910,Pillar 3: Private pension provision,H,NA
43811,201910,"With the so-called self-provision, the 1st and 2nd pillars can be supplemented individually.",504,NA
43811,201910,"In addition to the tax incentives, the uncertainties surrounding the financing of the 1st and 2nd pillars have made the 3rd pillar even more attractive.",504,NA
43811,201910,"However, paying into the 3rd pillar requires corresponding disposable income and is therefore not accessible to all income classes in practice.",504,NA
43811,201910,Additional support for private pension provision could therefore be linked to a certain solidarity component.,504,NA

43811,201910,Linking retirement age and life expectancy,H,NA
43811,201910,Various discussions surrounding the retirement age have repeatedly shown that political and emotional aspects drown out economic facts.,504,NA
43811,201910,"This has been impressively demonstrated, for example, by the discussion about retirement age 67.",504,NA
43811,201910,Rationally speaking - and also with a view to developments in other countries - it would have to be acknowledged that the retirement age would probably be in the region of 70 years around 2050.,504,NA
43811,201910,"In order to better take into account the economic facts given by the demographic development, the question of the retirement age must be depoliticized.",504,NA
43811,201910,The BDP calls for the introduction of an automatic mechanism that will in future automatically adjust the retirement age in line with rising life expectancy.,504,NA
43811,201910,"Despite differences in life expectancy, the retirement age for women and men is assumed to be the same.",503,NA
43811,201910,"Likewise, occupation-specific and individual flexibilities should continue to be possible - within a certain bandwidth.",701,NA
43811,201910,"However, the central aspect of automaticity is that, together with life expectancy, not only the statutory retirement age rises, but also the actual retirement age.",504,NA
43811,201910,So the bandwidth within which flexibilities are possible must also be part of the automatism.,701,NA
43811,201910,The BDP raised this demand for a link between retirement age and life expectancy in a motion and a parliamentary initiative as early as 2012 and 2013.,504,NA
43811,201910,"With the retirement of the baby boomer cohorts and after (yet another) failed pension reform, the demand for a link between retirement age and life expectancy is still highly topical.",504,NA
43811,201910,It is the most effective measure for the sustainable restructuring of the social security system.,504,NA
43811,201910,Debt brake,H,NA
43811,201910,The BDP is calling for fiscal rules for the AHV (and IV) that limit the indebtedness of the two social security funds.,414,NA
43811,201910,The fiscal rules should include the following elements:,H,NA
43811,201910,"A trigger must be provided that defines the financial threshold / the amount of the deficit / the fund assets as a percentage of expenditure or the debt as a percentage of contributions, above which political measures are mandatory.",414,NA
43811,201910,"The political mandate, which measures the political actors have to take in which timeframes, in case the trigger is exceeded, has to be defined.",414,NA
43811,201910,"Automatically triggered measures must be provided for if the political mandate is not implemented within certain deadlines, so that a further slide of the social security system into financial imbalance can be prevented.",414,NA
43811,201910,A moderate consideration of the economic situation and the inclusion of the expected future development are to be examined.,414,NA
43811,201910,The comparatively good state of public finances in our country in an international context is due not least to the debt brake.,414,NA
43811,201910,This instrument ensures that federal spending does not exceed revenues over a business cycle and prevents debt from spiraling out of control.,414,NA
43811,201910,"In the revision approved by the Swiss electorate in 2010, such a rule was also introduced for unemployment insurance (ALV).",414,NA
43811,201910,"However, the old-age and survivors' insurance (AHV) and the disability insurance (IV) are not subject to such control today.",414,NA
43811,201910,"Rather, both the entitlements of beneficiaries and the contributions to these social welfare funds are fixed by law, without any guarantee that the revenues will actually cover the expenditures.",414,NA
43811,201910,"In view of the financial imbalance in which the AHV finds itself, there is a great danger that a restructuring cannot be realized or can be realized much too late as a result of political blockades.",414,NA
43811,201910,This can be prevented in the future with a debt brake.,414,NA
43811,201910,The BDP already called for a debt brake for the social security funds in March 2011.,414,NA
43811,201910,The identical motions 11.3106 by the BDP parliamentary group and 11.3113 by BDP Council of States member Werner Luginbühl instructed the Federal Council to provide for mandatory fiscal rules in the 11th AHV revision and the 6th IV revision. Parliament approved Werner Luginbühl's motion.,NA,NA
43811,201910,"The introduction of fiscal rules was written off in connection with the 2020 pension bill, which failed before the people.",414,NA
43811,201910,"However, the failure of the 2020 pension plan does not change the urgency of introducing a debt brake.",414,NA
43811,201910,The BDP will therefore submit corresponding proposals again in May 2019.,414,NA
43811,201910,Early savings in the pension fund,H,NA
43811,201910,"As a further measure to secure old-age provision, the BDP considers it sensible if, instead of paying into the 2nd pillar from the age of 25 as is currently the case, contributions are now paid into the 2nd pillar from the age of 18 or after completion of initial education.",504,NA
43811,201910,"Not only with the increase of the retirement age is a higher deposit period achieved, but also if you start saving earlier.",504,NA
43811,201910,The longer deposit period and the higher savings amount have a positive effect on compound interest in particular.,504,NA
43811,201910,People who do not yet receive a salary at the age of 18 (students) often later receive a higher salary corresponding to their education and thus save a higher retirement capital.,504,NA
43811,201910,The situation is different for employees who do not undergo special training.,504,NA
43811,201910,"As a rule, their salary remains lower and the longer payment period pays off at the end in the saved capital.",504,NA
43811,201910,"In the case of pension funds, these persons are already covered from the age of 18 and pay risk premiums.",504,NA
43811,201910,The administrative effort is therefore justifiable.,504,NA
43811,201910,"Moreover, this would not be more than consistent with the AHV, where the obligation to pay in also starts at the age of 18.",504,NA
43811,201910,"In September 2012, the BDP parliamentary group submitted a postulate on this (12.3811), which was accepted by parliament.",504,NA
43811,201910,"The postulate was written off in connection with the ""Retirement Provision 2020"" bill.",504,NA
43811,201910,"The ""Altersvorsorge 2020"" has been rejected by the sovereign, but earlier savings in the pension fund were never the subject of criticism and must therefore be pursued.",504,NA
43811,201910,The BDP will therefore submit a corresponding motion again in May 2019.,504,NA
43811,201910,Improved labor market opportunities for the older generation,H,NA
43811,201910,The increase in the retirement age demanded by the BDP only makes sense if the current disadvantage of older job seekers can be largely eliminated.,503,NA
43811,201910,"Today, those who lose their jobs shortly before retirement age remain unemployed in most cases.",503,NA
43811,201910,"Especially recently, this issue has been widely and emotionally discussed among the population.",503,NA
43811,201910,"The reasons for this disadvantage may vary; but pension fund contributions, which increase with aging, are undoubtedly partly to blame.",503,NA
43811,201910,"From the employer's point of view in particular, this makes older workers ""more expensive"".",503,NA
43811,201910,"This can be a decisive criterion, especially for SMEs, for not considering older job seekers despite their experience and expertise, often for simple economic reasons.",503,NA
43811,201910,"In December 2012, the BDP therefore called for a package of measures to improve labor market opportunities for the older generation.",503,NA
43811,201910,"In particular, a standardization of the LOB rates should be examined.",503,NA
43811,201910,"The National Council accepted the corresponding postulate; unfortunately, the Council of States rejected it.",503,NA
43811,201910,"However, on May 4, 2017, the BDP submitted a motion calling specifically for the disadvantages of the older generation in the BVG to be abolished and for a uniform rate to be introduced for retirement credits.",503,NA
43811,201910,Strengthening private pension provision with a simultaneous solidarity component,H,NA
43811,201910,"Under pillar 3a, individuals can invest a maximum amount (CHF 6,826 for 2019) in private pension provision each year and deduct this payment from their taxable income.",504,NA
43811,201910,"This is an attractive and sensible supplement to the 1st and 2nd pillars, which strengthens individual pension provision, but is also suitable for home savings, for example.",504,NA
43811,201910,The 3rd pillar does not include a solidarity component.,504,NA
43811,201910,Expanding the options under pillar 3a could introduce a solidarity contribution on the one hand and additionally strengthen private pension provision on the other.,504,NA
43811,201910,"For example, a so-called pillar 3a+ could be created, which would allow a further retirement savings account in addition to the existing pillar 3a, into which the maximum amount can also be paid and deducted from taxable income.",504,NA
43811,201910,"However, before the amount paid in is credited to the account, (for example) 8.4% (today's AHV contribution) is deducted and (for example) added to the AHV.",504,NA
43811,201910,Building up a 3rd pillar as a private pension requires a rather higher disposable income.,504,NA
43811,201910,"With an additional expansion, however, not only the higher incomes are to be favored, but at the same time a solidarity contribution is to be paid.",504,NA
43811,201910,"In December 2012, the BDP therefore called for the expansion of the 3rd pillar with additional options for private provision and a simultaneous solidarity component, without finding a majority for this in the National Council.",504,NA
43811,201910,"With these positions and demands, the BDP would like to make a contribution to the long-term and sustainable safeguarding of social security systems, while at the same time emphasizing economic considerations over political ones.",504,NA
