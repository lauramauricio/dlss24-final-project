43110,199910,"For a sustainable Switzerland Election platform 1999 The Greens are pleased to present an election platform for an ecological, social and open-minded Switzerland. - to briefly present a sustainable Switzerland. In responsibility towards future generations, we are committed to the preservation of livelihoods, human rights and the reduction of disparities between rich and poor. Think globally - act in Switzerland: for a long-term oriented parliament 99. Sustainable with an environmental offensive. We want to move Switzerland forward ecologically. At its core is ecological tax reform, which reduces energy consumption and creates jobs. Phasing out nuclear energy by 2014 at the latest, Climate protection, Shifting heavy goods traffic to rail and organic farming instead of genetic engineering are further points of our program. Such commitment is essential to provide acceptable living conditions for the people of the South and for future generations. Sustainable with a social Switzerland. We want a Switzerland in which social security is also guaranteed in the future. The right-wing parties want to dismantle Social Security, others just want to preserve it. The Greens want to shape the social Switzerland of the future with reforms. This includes a new supplementary benefit for children and the unemployed as well as a reform of the second pillar. With modern concepts of the division of labor, we want to ensure that gainful and non-gainful work is distributed fairly among women and men. Sustainable with an opening of Switzerland. We want to join the European Union and the United Nations (UN). Switzerland should have a say in Europe, as more and more decisions are being made there that also concern us. The Greens are already working closely with the European Greens. By joining the UN, we strengthen Switzerland, assume global co-responsibility and show international solidarity. The Greens are an innovative and united party. As the strongest non-government party, we don't have to take any false considerations. As the party with the largest proportion of women among voters and on committees, we set the pace. As a member of the European Greens, we are used to working together across borders. In the coming years, the Greens will once again be the driving force for a sustainable Switzerland. To this end, on the one hand, we seek to network with organizations and initiatives that work on issues that are important to us. On the other hand, we are looking for majorities in parliament for our concerns. Sometimes the green-red third of the council puts pressure for change. Sometimes we also advocate positions almost alone, which are only taken up later. More and more often, we are part of a ""coalition of reason"", which is capable of winning a majority thanks to the merging of the green-red third with the more open part of the bourgeois parties. Many reforms began with a Green advance and ended - often years later - with a victory in the referendum. Real reform is only possible with us. Assuming responsibility by joining the EU and the UN and having a say where decisions are made The Greens have a positive attitude toward European integration. European cooperation is necessary because ecology and social issues also require cross-border solutions. Switzerland must have a say in decisions that are also important for it. Economic globalization requires, a fortiori, an international level capable of action. Accession opens up opportunities, for example, for study and work stays in EU countries. But the EU also has weaknesses. These are the same things that the Greens are fighting against in Switzerland: Short-term economic thinking, unecological policies, social deficits. In addition, there is still a large democratic deficit. Our Yes to Europe is therefore at the same time a Yes to changing the EU in an ecological, social and democratic direction. To this end, as a member of the ""European Greens"", we work together with Greens in all European countries. The Greens are committed to a rapid start of accession negotiations with the EU. After their result, a decision on accession is to be made. At the same time, possible EU accession must be coupled with social and ecological reforms at home. In the negotiations with the EU, framework conditions for maintaining an ecological transport policy in Switzerland must be achieved. Bilateral agreements between Switzerland and the EU: The Greens are calling for effective accompanying measures to the agreements on land and passenger transport (see also the chapter on transport). Our thinking does not stop at the borders of ""Europe"". In addition to a strong EU, it is imperative to have an influential UN. That is why we vehemently plead for Switzerland to join the UN as soon as possible. Keywords: Rapid start of accession negotiations with the EU, democratic reform in Switzerland with constructive referendum and negotiation guidelines initiative, increased Swiss involvement in the OSCE and the Council of Europe, Switzerland's commitment to an ecological and social WTO round, increase of the budget for development cooperation to OECD standards. We are proactive: support for the ""Yes to Europe"" initiative and the UN accession initiative We think ahead: Green position on European policy. Reduce energy consumption, phase out nuclear power and create jobs with ecological tax reform With the ""Yes"" to the energy article and the ""Yes"" to the nuclear moratorium, the people have set the guidelines for the energy policy of the future. Nevertheless, there is still little sign of an energy turnaround. Energy prices are lower than ever before. This prevents the necessary efficiency revolution for the rational use of energy. Electricity market liberalization will reinforce this. We therefore want to gradually increase energy prices with an ecological tax reform. The proceeds of the energy tax are to be used to partially or fully finance social insurance. This gives us a ""double dividend"": the reduction in environmental impact from the energy tax and the reduction in unemployment from the reduction in the cost of wages. The ecological tax reform promotes the entry into efficient energy use and the use of renewable energies and enables the phase-out of nuclear energy by 2014 at the latest. The Greens want to leave the risky nuclear path as quickly as possible. Keywords: Follow-up program for ""Energy 2000"", immediate decommissioning of the old Mühleberg and Beznau nuclear power plants, decommissioning of the Gösgen and Leibstadt nuclear power plants as quickly as possible, Redirection of research funds from nuclear and fusion energy to rational energy use and renewable energy sources, Renunciation of uncontrolled repositories for nuclear waste, To this end, development of a concept with retrievability and controllability, Stop the reprocessing of nuclear waste, Abandonment of the Wellenberg site, Avoiding the construction of further hydropower plants and pumped-storage reservoirs (Grimsel and others). We are proactive: On May 22, 1996, the Green Party submitted the popular initiative ""For a secure AHV - tax energy instead of work. We are co-sponsors of the ""Energy Environment Initiative"" as well as the initiatives ""Electricity without Nuclear"" and ""Moratorium Plus"" We think ahead: Green position on energy policy Documentation on the initiative ""Tax Energy Instead of Work"" 10 Questions - 10 Answers on the initiative ""Tax Energy Instead of Work For a fair distribution of gainful and inactive work Persistent unemployment is one of the biggest problems. The declining numbers in the unemployment statistics are deceptive: Many people have been disemployed and are no longer included in the statistics. Even with an improved economic situation, a relatively high base unemployment rate will remain. Rising labor productivity - it takes less and less human labor to produce goods and services - exacerbates the problem. By sharing the workload, people want to enable more people to participate in the workforce again. At the same time, however, domestic, educational, care and community work should be distributed more equitably. Today, this is done, mostly unpaid, mainly by women. To this end, the Greens want to create market-based incentives (bonus-malus model for companies) and remove existing obstacles to family care based on partnership (for example, double coordination deduction in occupational pension plans). The Greens want to introduce a flexible retirement age from 62 for women and men. Social existence is not only based on paid work. Therefore, the livelihood security in Switzerland must be improved. While old-age insurance works well in most cases, a poverty trap exists for many life situations: single mothers and fathers, long-term unemployment, etc. The Greens want to solve this problem with supplementary benefits and, in the longer term, a guaranteed subsistence level. Keywords: reduction of daily, weekly or annual working hours (by means of economic incentives = bonus-malus system for AHV/ALV contributions); Interruption of gainful employment for further training; Promotion of part-time positions in public administration; Promotion of a supplementary labor market for labor market and social reintegration; Reintegration minimum subsistence level; Promotion of crèches and day schools; Reduction in social security contributions via energy taxation We are proactive: motion to introduce a bonus-malus system Green popular initiative ""For a secure AHV - taxing energy instead of work"" Green popular initiative ""For a flexible retirement age from 62 for women and men"" Project for a guaranteed minimum subsistence level We think ahead: ""Working differently - living better"" brochure Green position on work and social security (to be published in summer 99) Documentation on the ""Taxing energy instead of labor"" initiative 10 questions - 10 answers on the ""Taxing energy instead of labor"" initiative Documentation on the initiative "" For a flexible retirement age from 62 for women and men "" 10 questions - 10 answers on the initiative "" For a flexible retirement age from 62 for women and men "" Green women and men go fifty-fifty The Greens are an attractive party for women. Half of all mandates and functions are held by women. The electorate and the party base are also half women. So we don't just talk about equality, we live it. On the other hand, the same cannot be said of society as a whole. Although the legal discriminations have been removed from the laws. Green women have persistently worked on this. But in fact, women are massively underrepresented everywhere in business and politics where important decisions are made. The Greens therefore advocate the introduction of quotas. These have been an important means of engaging political minorities in Switzerland for years. The policy of equality falls short if women take over the previous duties of men without being able to share their own duties. When women want to hand over and share responsibilities, men are needed to take them on. The Greens are therefore committed to a fair distribution of paid and unpaid work between the sexes. The comprehensive recognition of unpaid work and living wages for women are necessary for this. Day schools and out-of-home childcare make it easier to reconcile unpaid and paid work. Keywords: Fifty-fifty: Quotas also for women, introduction of job sharing, fair distribution of paid and unpaid work between the sexes, maternity insurance and paternity leave, promotion of day schools and out-of-home childcare, general reduction of weekly working hours, guaranteed livelihood for children, equality of non-marital cohabitation, Marriage option for same-sex couples, inter-agency actions and interventions to combat family violence, creation of a central office for women's health at the federal level, abortion without indication and compulsory counseling, no access to the egg cell, no compulsion for prenatal diagnostics, consideration of ""gender and development"" (GAD) approach as a basis for development cooperation. We are proactive: We initiated the initiative ""For a fair representation of women in federal authorities""(Quoten-Initiative). We think ahead: Green position on women and men Integration instead of exclusion: For a humane and solidary asylum and migration policy For us Greens, the free decision to settle in another country is a human right. So we don't assume that people can only be happy in their home country. However, the decision to migrate should be made freely and not out of compulsion and necessity. However, this is often not the case, because the worldwide distribution of goods, money and resources has become even more unjust in recent years due to the globalization of markets and an increasingly aggressive neo-capitalism. Commitment to a more just world, against war and militarism and against the destruction of livelihoods is the most sustainable migration policy. Some of the people who have fled crises arrive in Switzerland as asylum seekers. The Greens defend the right to asylum and oppose further tightening of the asylum law. In particular, we expect a generous reception of war victims from Kosova and solidarity with the community of workers who have lived in our country for a long time. The Greens oppose the initiative ""for a regulation of immigration"". The realization of the free movement of persons with the EU must not result in additional discrimination against immigrants from countries outside the EU. We also want a more open attitude for the many foreigners who have lived in Switzerland for years or were even born here. They were called to Switzerland in earlier years for economic reasons. In the coming years, Switzerland needs an offensive integration policy, easier naturalization, especially for young foreigners, and an offensive stance against racism. Excluding foreigners, for example at school, is the wrong approach. Keywords: Introduction of the free movement of persons with accompanying measures, Introduction of a single-window law, Facilitation of the naturalization procedure, political rights at municipal level, including voting rights for foreigners and residence status for women regardless of their marital status, Recognition of gender-specific reasons for flight, Recognition of sexual orientation as a reason for fleeing, Equality of homosexual partnerships with heterosexual partnerships, Abolition of coercive measures, no tightening of asylum law. We are proactive: The Greens support the referenda against the revision of the Asylum Act and the federal resolution on urgent measures in the area of asylum and foreigners. We think ahead: Green position on migration policy More public transport, combined mobility, less environmental pollution Mobility is part of our lives, it is the basis of encounter and communication. Today, however, mobility has reached a level that is no longer environmentally compatible. In a transport policy of the future, the optics of motorized road users must no longer prevail. The Greens take into account the needs of all those affected, in particular residents, women, disabled people, children and weaker road users such as cyclists. Public transport is more environmentally friendly than private motorized transport and should therefore continue to be promoted. The Green Party is committed to the further development of the regional train network. For finer access off the main lines and for off-peak times and special needs, we rely on flexible models of combined mobility such as call buses, bike+ride and car-sharing. In the area of air transport, Switzerland must lobby at the international level for the taxation of aviation fuel. The Greens have scored a success with the acceptance of the performance-based heavy vehicle fee in the referendum. The population has thus once again expressed that the goods belong on the railroad as much as possible. The Greens - together with the European Greens - are committed to the consistent implementation of the article on the protection of the Alps and thus to the shift of transalpine traffic to rail. NEAT, which is supported by the Greens, will support this. The land transport agreement with the EU must be accompanied by effective domestic policy measures. Keywords: traffic-free city centers and residential areas, 30 km/h in urban areas, calming of main roads in urban areas, Lowering the alcohol limit to 0.5 per mille, Probationary driver's license, Offsetting of external costs, no cuts in regional public transport, no expansion of the national roads, Abolition of fuel duty earmarking, Implementation of the Alpine protection article, No second Gotthard tunnel, Taxation of aviation fuel, higher landing and noise charges at airports, Replacement of medium-haul flights by rail. We are proactive: The Greens support the initiative ""For halving road traffic"" (""Umverkehr""), the ""Sunday Initiative"" for four car-free Sundays per year and the initiative ""Roads for all"". We think ahead: 1.Green position on transport policy Organic farming instead of GM food on the plate The Swiss population has shown several times that it wants a green turn in agricultural policy. More ecology and more market, is the motto. The Greens want to continue along this path: All agricultural protection measures are to be tied to ecological performance and compliance with animal-friendly husbandry practices. Limits are to be applied in the case of high incomes or assets. Organic production is to be transformed from niche to mainstream production. Organic quality also opens up new export opportunities for Swiss agriculture. We are committed to ensuring that the environmental social goals of the new Farm Bill are not watered down. However, the GM industry now wants to turn the wheel back: industrial GM food instead of organic quality, is their motto. In doing so, it accepts that biological production will become contaminated and thus ultimately impossible. The Greens therefore oppose the release of genetically manipulated organisms. The Federal Office for the Environment, Forests and Landscape has also recognized these risks and recently rejected two release applications. We also reject the patenting of genetically modified organisms and the production of transgenic animals. In the remaining areas, strict control is to ensure the necessary safety. Keywords: compulsory declaration of foodstuffs, incentive taxes on pesticides and fertilizers, no direct payments without binding ecological facilities, no genetically modified or irradiated foodstuffs, no patenting of living beings, no release of genetically manipulated organisms, no transgenic animals. We are proactive: Parliamentary initiative Hans Meier: All farm animals outdoors. Motion Ruedi Baumann: Abolition of milk quotas We think ahead: Green position on genetic engineering Legalize cannabis products, dispense hard drugs in a controlled manner, eliminating misery, drug crime and mafia profits For years, Switzerland followed the drug policy of the political right: Drug users were policed and sued. Even today, 80 percent of convictions involve consumption, more than half of which involve the use of cannabis products. The consequences were serious: the drug mafia made strong profits, many heavy drug addicts ended up in misery or died from the consequences of consumption. The use of drugs could not be stopped. In recent years, Switzerland changed its policy. In scientific trials with medical supervision, heroin and cocaine were prescribed - with positive consequences: Patients' health improved, and social integration was significantly improved. But Switzerland still relies more on repression than on therapy, survival assistance and prevention. The Greens therefore want to go one step further: The use of drugs must be decriminalized. We stand for the release of soft drugs and controlled distribution of hard drugs. The trial drug dispensary is to be gradually expanded. This is the way to reintegrate drug addicts into society. This will also make it possible to eliminate the impoverishment of drug addicts, drug-related crime and the drug mafia. Instead of squandering the money on repression, it can be used more sensibly for prevention, therapy and survival assistance. Keywords: legalization of cannabis, decriminalization of drug use, expansion of controlled drug distribution, more suitable therapy places, rapid revision of the Narcotics Act, increased prevention also for legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco We are initiating: Proposal of the Green Group of the Federal Assembly for the legalization of cannabis products. We think ahead: Green position on drug policy For more democracy and a level playing field before elections and votes Democracy must be further developed by expanding the people's rights (e.g. legislative initiative, financial referendum), by gradually introducing voting rights for settled foreigners and by strengthening the elected bodies vis-à-vis the administration and internal associations. Federalism must ensure decisions and responsibilities close to the citizens by decentralizing competencies and decision-making structures to the lowest possible levels. New institutions, such as neighborhood councils within large cities or cross-border regional councils, must enable the solution of concrete problems by the population directly affected. The Greens reject the Federal Council's ever-increasing PR efforts in recent years to influence opinion in the run-up to votes. Instead, the federal government should ensure that the various opinions are disseminated as evenly as possible before elections and votes and, if necessary, ensure this with financial contributions. In return, the financial expenditures of private organizations must be disclosed and limited prior to elections and votes. Internet at school and media libraries for all instead of informational exclusion If the information society is to be an opportunity for all, access to information must be open to all. The transformation of libraries into media libraries as well as a funding program ""Media Education and Internet at School"" should support this access. Media education should become an integral part of teaching and help students find their way through the diversity of media. The new media are also to be used to revive direct democracy: in future, it will be possible to participate in votes, initiatives and referendums via the Internet. At the heart of the democratic information society called for by the Greens is the right to informational self-determination. This means that all citizens can freely obtain information and also feed it into interactive information networks themselves. The limits of this freedom lie in the dissemination of criminal content. Finally, informational self-determination also includes comprehensive data protection, which ensures that personal data cannot be misused. Measures to promote a democratic information society must be complemented with measures for social and ecological development. Ecological devices should have the least possible impact on the environment during production, use and application. Social measures such as the division of labor represent a corrective to the rationalizations that are possible, not least due to information and communication technologies. Keywords: basic supply for all at the same price, Media libraries, media training in education and further education, funding program ""Media training and Internet at school"", Expansion of data protection, no restriction of encryption, Revision of the law against unfair competition with the aim of making critical reporting possible again, Tariff reductions for newspaper delivery, Maintaining a full program service for radio and television in all language regions, Division of labor instead of a two-tier society. We think ahead: Green position on the information society For an active peace policy based on solidarity As a neutral country not bound to any military alliance and with its material resources, Switzerland is called upon to become much more involved in peace policy than it is today. The Greens are in favor of humanitarian missions abroad and assistance in peacekeeping interventions within the framework of the UN or OSCE. The Greens reject the idea of joining NATO. We are proactive: The Greens support peace policy initiatives Additional chapter according to DV of 8.5.99: Economic policy Adoption by the Board of Directors on 19.6.99 Appendix: Five Criteria for Green Policy Long-term: Every political decision must be examined for its long-term consequences on the ecological balance and on the future of human society. Quality: A continuation of quantitative growth is impossible in the long term insofar as it is based on the accelerated exploitation of non-renewable resources or resources available only in limited quantities. because it is based on limited resources in a limited system. The further development of our society and our economy must therefore be oriented toward qualitative rather than quantitative improvements. Solidarity: We understand our solidarity as the permanent inclusion of the mutual relations between the different living beings, the different forms of society and, within a society, between the different groups and individuals. Decentralization: This concern is central to all power structures for us. The Greens want all responsibilities to be exercised at the lowest possible level. State intervention must be limited to areas or activities where harmonization is necessary in the general interest Diversity: We consider the diversity of living beings and species to be the wealth of a complex nature. Paralles to this, cultural diversity represents the wealth of humanity. The protection of this natural and cultural diversity is a constant struggle against the blind exploitation of nature and against the tendencies towards uniformity that characterize the technocracy that dominates our society today. The diversity of desires is an important factor in the survival and stability of society. It is an eminently important task to work towards their preservation."
43110,200310,"Another world is possible Green Switzerland Manifesto We Greens have the vision that all people should live in dignity in a healthy environment. and peace. But the present state of the earth gives little reason for hope. Furthermore, a small part of mankind is squandering natural resources. Whole regions of our planet no longer have a secure supply of drinking water. The frightening consequences of global warming are becoming increasingly apparent: our country is also experiencing repeated severe weather disasters. The gap between rich and poor is widening. An ever-increasing proportion of humanity lives below the poverty line. Even in the richest countries, poverty and impoverishment are increasing at a devastating rate. We Greens are convinced that this development can be reversed, but we must act decisively now. We take a holistic approach to preserving our planet and preventing any exclusion of people. Ecological living and acting is by no means limited to environmental protection and species conservation. Political ecology also includes the further development of democracy, equality between women and men, social security and a better quality of life, to name just these examples. We Greens are convinced that a life without war and oppression is possible in tolerance and mutual respect. In order to realize this different world, we need a strong and diverse commitment: in parliaments, at the workplace, in residential quarters, in trade unions, clubs and other organizations, right down to our circle of friends. We need widespread and adaptable networks to deepen collaboration with all engaged and interested circles and individuals. We Greens are on the move and are actively involved in the movement for a livable existence. An economy at the service of all Short-term profit-seeking is the mainspring of the capitalist market economy, which produces enormous quantities of goods and capital, but distributes them in an extremely unjust manner. This economic system disturbs the ecological balance that would be the necessary basis of sustainable development; it aggravates and accelerates pollution and degrades the quality of the most important bases of life, such as water, air and food. People have created this system. People can also change it again. An end to the pursuit of profit maximization We Greens want to put a stop to this profit maximization. It drives the majority of peoples into poverty and misery because multinational corporations monopolize the necessities of life. We oppose these privatisations and liberalizations, which endanger social cohesion and curtail the rights of the people. And we fight against banking secrecy, from which criminals and tax evaders profit. The fight against the ideology of growth is by no means over, as some think. On the contrary, it is becoming increasingly clear that the state of the earth and the quality of life of its people cannot be measured by the quantity of goods produced. Today's profit hunt inevitably leads to an ecological catastrophe and endangers the survival of all humanity. One of the central challenges of the 21st century is to fundamentally rethink the current mode of production and the distribution of goods and power. This means that the interests of employees must be given appropriate consideration in company decisions. and their co-determination rights in the workplace must be expanded and enshrined in law. Drinking water and free access to seeds for all We Greens advocate a fair distribution of goods, some of which should be withdrawn from market logic: For example, water must be considered a common good of mankind and should be freely accessible to all. The same applies to seeds, which must belong to the farmers. And public services must not become a commodity under any circumstances. We are committed to appropriate working conditions and for a minimum wage of CHF 3,000 net per month in Switzerland. We demand mandatory social plans in the event of layoffs and company bankruptcies, as well as fines for companies that lay off employees despite flourishing business. Cooperatives and especially social enterprises should be able to take out preferential loans. It goes without saying that our vision of economic and social justice can only be realized if international trade rules are transformed and democratized. A first step in this direction would be a massively higher tax on profits and international financial transactions. Yes to a clear reduction in working hours The amount of labor required for the production of goods is declining more and more. This creates a unique opportunity to change two imbalances simultaneously: both the one between overworked employees and discouraged unemployed, and the one between paid and unpaid work. Removing these imbalances would also allow for a better distribution of roles between men and women. Therefore, a significant reduction in working hours is a key element for the emancipation of all people. We are also committed to a flexible retirement age (starting at 60 for those in hard labor), real maternity insurance , and parental and educational leave. It goes without saying that all people, regardless of their status or living situation, should be entitled to an income that enables them to live in dignity. That is why we advocate a minimum living wage, the form of which has yet to be determined. The prerequisites for a generous and fair social policy are a strongly progressive tax system, an inheritance tax, a wealth and capital gains tax, and the renunciation of excessive and unecological investments. The time of the sorcerer's apprentices is over For decades, nuclear technology was touted as a miracle cure to solve all energy problems. Today we know better. We are fighting for the immediate and definitive phase-out of nuclear energy, for a drastic reduction in energy consumption and for the development of renewable energies such as solar and wind power. Other sorcerer's apprentices also want to play their games with our lives. They are the gene manipulators. There is a great danger that genetically modified organisms - the notorious GMOs - will multiply uncontrollably, transfer to other plants or living organisms , and cause mutations and irreversible damage. We find it extremely disconcerting when advocates of genetic research rejoice in the development of a few new variants of an organism, while at the same time thousands of natural species are being destroyed. We are not hostile to research. But we question the unconditional belief in progress and blind faith in technological feasibility. The value and meaning of life must be at the forefront of the debate, and only then can the research objectives and the application of the ""discoveries"" be discussed. We Greens say no to GMOs in agriculture, no to the manipulation of living beings, especially embryos. We reject the patenting and commercialization of living beings. On the other hand, we demand the full declaration of the composition, origin and production method of all food products. Healthy food deserves fair prices that cover costs as much as possible and protection from undeclared imported cheap products. In addition, direct payments must guarantee small and medium-sized farms a minimum living income in order to halt the death of farmers and the exodus from rural areas. Only decentralized local food production enables the world's population to be adequately fed. For people-friendly mobility More than half of freight transport serves only to increase the profits of some entrepreneurs. For example, Spanish vegetables are produced by Moroccan workers at starvation wages and with extreme use of chemicals, shipped thousands of kilometers, only to cause the bankruptcy of Swiss farmers. Should there really soon be only that single tomato variety in Europe that is cheapest to produce and comes to the market unripe and stuffed with pesticides and preservatives? Yes to rail transport and local production We Greens want to prevent further growth in international truck and air traffic. We call for the transfer of freight traffic to rail. The road should serve only for short distances and for regional fine distribution. In particular, we want to strengthen the relationship between local production and local consumption. The consequences of the still growing motorized passenger traffic are also devastating. We fight against a boundless concreting over of our landscape and any further clogging of our cities by private traffic. We Greens prefer car-free, vibrant neighborhoods and cities. We are committed to bicycle paths in a healthy environment, pedestrian zones and attractive, environmentally friendly and affordable public transport. In any case, the use of public transport must be less expensive than traveling by private car. We are in favor of a massive increase in fuel duty, with exemptions for the population of peripheral regions. Finally, we are fighting the expansion of air traffic. This contributes to a particularly high degree to air pollution and the greenhouse effect, brings unacceptable noise pollution to the population in the airport regions and represents an incalculable danger for the regions flown over. For us Greens, it is clear that kerosene must finally be taxed massively. In return, neglected international rail transport must be upgraded, modernized and equipped with the necessary capacities. Live together It is a paradox : while the borders are opened wide for trade flows, they are closed for people, especially for victims of war and economic injustice. We Greens defend the principle of a multicultural society. Freedom to settle in any region should be a human right. We strongly oppose the current discriminatory and arbitrary policies of the authorities. It is often inhumane to asylum seekers, grants very limited rights to migrants, and forces those without legal status to live in degrading conditions. It thus becomes a breeding ground for more xenophobia and racism. We demand a collective admission regulation for those without papers, easier naturalization regulations, the abolition of the racist two-circle model, political rights for foreigners and a more generous admission of violent refugees. In doing so, we are by no means indulging in naïve illusions: The arguments about one or another way of life and way of thinking can be very fierce. But we have to find solutions for living together instead of rejecting ""the others"". In this sense, we reject all violence, especially war, as a means of conflict resolution. We call for a drastic cut in the military budget in favor of a stronger commitment to peace. The ever closer cooperation between the Swiss Armed Forces and NATO or even joining NATO is something we reject. We Greens feel like Europeans and global citizens. We are striving to join the European Union. We support fair trade and want to strengthen Swiss development cooperation and provide it with significantly more resources. Adopted by the DP on 24. August 2002"
43110,200710,"GREEN - THE ALTERNATIVE WITH A FUTURE National elections will be held on October 21, 2007. The goal for these elections is clear for us Greens: we want to win additional seats in the National Council and we want to move into the Council of States. Because Switzerland needs more green policies. Green policy for the environment, for a sustainable economy and for social and global justice. ""We Greens have the vision that all people can live in dignity and peace in a healthy environment. We are committed to preserving the natural foundations of life and to social, economic and political justice. We are convinced that a life without war and in harmony with nature is possible."" With this vision, the Green Party of Switzerland has appealed to more and more people since the last national elections. The Greens have won additional seats in virtually all municipal and cantonal elections since 2003. While on the one hand the bourgeois majority in Switzerland shuns environmental protection, propagates blind economic growth, social cuts and less state, on the other hand there is growing support for green politics, a politics that stubbornly advocates an ecological, social and open Switzerland. We want to continue this committed, sustainable policy. For the 2007 national elections, we are contesting with four priorities: ecologically consistent: safeguarding the basis of life is the challenge of the 21st century! The course must be set now for the switch to renewable energies by 2050, for stopping global warming, and for a sustainable regional planning, settlement and transport policy. For the next legislative period, more green women and men are needed in parliament to help shape the necessary ecological transformation in Switzerland with innovative proposals. economically sustainable: ""Economic growth above all else"" is the credo - from the bourgeois parties to the trade unions. The blind faith in growth and profit accepts that the environment is destroyed and poverty increases. We Greens want an economy that is environmentally and socially compatible in terms of sustainability. The Swiss economy is doing well. That is why the opportunity is particularly favorable now to drive forward the ecological transformation of the economy and to shape the labor market in terms of long-term integration. There is a need for more green women and men in parliament who are committed to a sustainable economy. socially committed: due to demographic change and in view of the diversity of lifestyles and lifestyles, new ideas are needed to shape social cohesion and social security. Neoliberal concepts that want to dismantle the welfare state and shift social responsibility to individuals do not solve the problems. Instead, we need creative proposals for the financing of social insurance and for a balance between government activities and individual responsibility. There is a need for more green women and men in parliament who are committed to a far-sighted social policy. global solidarity: Switzerland is a small country, but it can play a significant role internationally. Unfortunately, the country's own economic interests have dominated foreign policy up to now. This is where countermeasures need to be taken. As a neutral country, Switzerland should not orient its foreign policy to the interests of multinationals, but to those of the poorest people in the world. The focus must be on global environmental protection, peace, respect for human rights, a humane migration policy and the democratization of international organizations. More Green women and men are needed in parliament to give a voice to the losers of globalization. Ecologically consistent - economically sustainable - socially committed - globally solidary, that is the slogan for which it is worth voting green! 1. VOTING GREEN: FOR CONSISTENT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION An intact environment forms the basis of our existence. Everyone needs clean air, clean water and a quiet environment. Unfortunately, this is not a matter of course, as the following facts illustrate: Every day, 11 hectares of cultivated land disappear in Switzerland - that is just under 1.3 square meters per second. and two thirds of this is newly used as settlement areas. The limit values for air pollutants are exceeded with unacceptable regularity. Already, 200 million people worldwide suffer from chronic water shortages, and as is so often the case, the poorest of the poor are affected. Furthermore, there is a threat of the privatization of the water market, which mainly benefits Western corporations. One third of known animal and plant species are already irreversibly extinct. 16,119 species worldwide are on the 2006 Red List and are thus threatened with extinction - 530 more than in 2004. One in eight birds and one in four mammals are now threatened with extinction. In Switzerland, species protection is particularly poor compared to neighboring countries. The protection of natural resources is the central challenge of the 21st century worldwide. In our society, economic interests are always valued more highly than an intact environment. The future of our planet and the right to life of future generations are severely threatened by this attitude. 15 years after the conference in Rio, it is clear that we are a long way from finding a solution to the urgent global environmental problems. Switzerland is not on a sustainability course either, as studies show. Today, the consumption of resources is almost five times higher than the level that corresponds to sustainable use and the carrying capacity of natural systems. Since Rio, CO2 emissions have increased despite the signing of the Kyoto Protocol. Sustainability can only be ensured if business, science, politics and society give priority to environmentally compatible action. To ensure that future generations are not robbed of the opportunity to meet their own needs, we must act with the greatest possible determination today. The Green Party is at the forefront of advocating ecologically consistent policies. Energy is clearly the key variable of sustainability. However, it is far from being the only problem area. Environmental policy should finally find its way into all sectors. Also in spatial planning, in research and in business. Because ecological management not only helps the environment, it also pays off. The Greens also firmly believe that there is no social justice without environmental justice. Resource justice is the basis of a world of global solidarity. We must therefore set the course for the future today. 1.1 Away from oil by 2030 Switzerland's energy supply is predominantly based on fossil fuels. A good 70 percent of Switzerland's energy consumption is covered by oil, natural gas and coal. Switzerland, once a pioneer in environmental protection, now functions at the top of the global CO2 emissions rankings. Environmental sins such as the massive emission of greenhouse gases are heating up the earth. But it is not only global warming that speaks against the use of fossil fuels. Oil production is expected to reach its peak as early as 2010 - after that, reserves will only decline and the price will rise. With peak oil, geopolitical conflicts and scandals involving corruption, human rights violations and environmental pollution in the oil business will increase significantly. It is time for Switzerland to get away from oil and become independent from foreign countries. Based on the Kyoto Protocol, Switzerland has committed itself with the CO2 Act to reduce CO2 emissions by 10 percent by the year 2010 compared to 1990. In the long term, the brake will have to be tightened even more. For Switzerland, according to ETH, this means a 75 percent reduction in fossil fuels by 2050 compared to 1990 (the 2000-watt society). The Green Party goes one step further. It calls for a complete phase-out of fossil fuels by 2030. Because when the bathtub overflows, the first thing you do is turn off the water. The looming global climate catastrophe is not the only evil caused by fossil fuels. In summer the ozone makes us sick and in winter the fine dust. To prevent this, the Clean Air Ordinance has been in force since 1986. But there is a huge problem with their implementation. Air pollution causes 3,700 deaths in Switzerland every year and follow-up costs in the billions. Countermeasures have long been known. For example, modern particulate filters. They retain over 90 percent of the soot particles. It or a comparable technology should finally become mandatory. The transition from the fossil age to the solar age must finally be decided today at the political level and implemented step by step. The sooner Switzerland takes the changeover seriously, the more socially and economically compatible it can be. The Greens are calling for Switzerland to take on a pioneering role in this regard. For the coming legislature, the Greens are calling for: a climate strategy for Switzerland that commits Switzerland to reducing its CO2 emissions by at least 75 percent by 2030. For the Greens, the goal is the complete phase-out of fossil fuels by 2030. The introduction of a comprehensive incentive tax on fossil fuels (e.g. gasoline, heating oil), which is reimbursed via health insurance. The climate cent must not be extended. The Greens maintain the goal of an ecological tax reform. the resolute promotion of public and non-motorized transport, the closing of mobility chains and, on a trial basis, the introduction of road pricing for traffic control in cities and agglomerations. the promotion of biofuels from biomass, provided that the production meets high ecological and social criteria and the energy balance including transport to Switzerland is posi-tive. In addition, biofuels must not compete with food production. an increase in the HVF for freight transport and its extension to vans weighing less than 3.5 tons. a tax on aviation fuel for international flights. Switzerland must promote a corresponding agreement at the international level. the targeted promotion of energy efficiency. Introduction of a consumption-based au-to import tax and a ban on imports of certain vehicles (in line with the Young Greens' offroa-der initiative). The federal government should introduce the energy label for buildings and provide the necessary subsidies for the cantons. high building standards for new buildings (Minergie-P) and energy-efficient building renovations. To this end, the federal government should negotiate binding target agreements with the cantons. The federal government and the cantons must provide the necessary subsidies. the amendment of tenancy law to allow homeowners to share in the energy consumption costs of tenants. This is the only way they will have an incentive to undertake energy-related renovations. an energy consumption declaration on foodstuffs to clarify the life cycle assessment. This notice should give consumers clear information about the consumption of gray energy (e.g. fuel consumption, heating, etc). the obligatory survey of the environmental impact, especially CO2 emissions, of companies above a certain size. tax incentives (bonus-malus) for companies to reduce their environmental impact, especially CO2 emissions. Companies that go beyond the legal mini-mum are to be rewarded. the introduction of environmental protection criteria in the tendering process for public contracts. Public sector contracts may only be awarded to companies that use machinery that is as environmentally friendly as possible (low energy consumption, low emissions, particulate filters, etc). the consistent implementation of the air and noise protection ordinance: mandatory filters for all new diesel vehicles and equipment, as well as mandatory retrofitting wherever technically and economically feasible. the introduction of speed limits and driving bans if the limit values are persistently exceeded. the legal anchoring of the right of residents and working people to take legal action. Anyone who is exposed to frequent exceedances of air and noise limits at their place of residence or workplace should be able to take legal action. financial sanctions by the federal government for defaulting cantons. 1.2 Electricity without nuclear and without large gas power plants Switzerland's energy future in the coming decades will be largely determined by two factors: oil depletion and global warming. Both force us to curb energy consumption. The Greens are therefore committed to the 2000-watt society. Its goal is to reduce the energy consumption of every resident by two-thirds. The Greens also want the remaining energy supply to be based exclusively on renewable sources by 2050: Hydropower, geothermal energy, biomass, windmills and solar energy (heat and electricity). This dual goal is entirely achievable through a combination of energy efficiency measures, conservation, and the promotion of renewable energy. With today's known efficiency technologies for buildings, electronic devices, cars and in industry alone, a reduction in energy consumption of 40 percent per year would be feasible. This would save CHF 12 billion across Switzerland in the same period: on heating oil bills, fuel and electricity bills. An energy policy that builds on energy efficiency and renewable energy promotes innovation - and thus also the phase-out of obsolete nuclear technology. The nuclear phase-out is a must from an economic, security and environmental perspective. A nuclear reactor accident, like the one in Chernobyl in 1986, is a human and ecological catastrophe. It would result in damage costs of around 4200 billion Swiss francs. If these costs had to be integrated into the insurance sum of the power plants and thus into the electricity price, each kilowatt hour would cost not a few centimes, but a few francs! The risk of accidents increases with each year of operation. The Nuclear Energy Act, which came into force in February 2005, and its Nuclear Energy Ordinance do not contain any hard shutdown criteria for nuclear power plants. And the disposal of radioactive waste and the decommissioning costs for the five Swiss nuclear power plants remain unresolved. The Greens will not agree to a solution for the storage of radioactive waste until the phase-out of nuclear energy has been irrevocably decided. For the Greens, the storage inventory must be retrievable and controllable. Transparency in the site selection process and democratic co-decision-making must be guaranteed. Nuclear technology is a non-renewable energy. Uranium reserves run out in 2075. Consequently, nuclear power plants are not an alternative transitional solution. The Greens are committed to green electricity and green fuels. But here, too, ecological criteria must be met. This is not always the case. Hydropower is not without problems in this context: in order to produce as much electricity as possible, residual flows are systematically not respected and water protection is thus consistently violated. For this reason, the Greens are against the expansion and new construction of large reservoirs. Skepticism is also warranted when it comes to biofuels. For example, we reject biofuels from intensive crops, which are harmful to the environment and endanger the food supply of producer countries. In order for renewable energies and energy efficiency to achieve a breakthrough, appropriate support is needed from the federal government and the cantons. For the Greens, ecological tax reform and cost-covering feed-in tariffs for renewable energies are the most efficient means of helping the energy transition achieve a breakthrough. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: an energy scenario for the Confederation based on the option of renewable energy and energy efficiency, rather than on the central large-scale technologies of nuclear, gas and hydropower. the gradual replacement of existing nuclear power plants with energy efficiency, energy saving and renewable energies. As a first step, we need an effective energy law that specifically promotes renewable energies and energy efficiency. a private-sector mandatory unlimited liability insurance for all nuclear power plants (including full passing on of the insurance premiums to the nuclear power price). A cost-covering feed-in tariff for renewable energies and a steering levy on all non-renewable energy sources. No new nuclear power plants and large gas plants, but a decentralized energy supply as far as possible. An increase in the annual budget of SwissEnergy to at least 100 million Swiss francs. In return, subsidies for nuclear research can be eliminated. a national energy policy. The Confederation determines the orientation and negotiates binding target agreements with the cantons. Delinquent cantons can be penalized via financial cuts at E nergieSchweiz. the public-law control of the electricity market. For this purpose, the high-voltage grid belongs to the cantons and municipalities. strict consumption regulations for electrical equipment. Electric heating and stand-by mode must be eliminated wherever possible. Strict labels and transparent declarations for energy consumption and energy production should be introduced consistently for all electrical appliances. the consistent implementation of water protection, in particular the residual water quantity in hydropower. 1.3 Restrict building zones - promote habitats The demand for space for housing and infrastructure has been growing unabated in Switzerland for years. The increase in single-family homes is particularly significant. Today, 70 percent of the population lives in cities and agglomerations. The merging of localities, the softening of the agricultural zone and the increasing use of the Alpine region as recreational zones lead to a devaluation of our living space. Local recreation is central to the quality of life. In addition to the actual natural areas such as mountains, lakes and forests, urban green spaces and agricultural areas are available for this purpose. But it is precisely these landscapes that are being severely squeezed by settlement pressure, fragmented by roads and in some cases massively overused. The steady growth of settlements in Switzerland is pulling the rug out from under the feet of nature and landscape conservation. If urban sprawl continues at its current pace, the very last square meter of agricultural land in Switzerland will be built over in about 340 years. With the existing building land reserves, our settlement area can grow by another third! The current spatial planning system is largely based on municipal autonomy. This leads to planning that is not regional and certainly not national. Coordination between the federal government and the cantons is also poor. At the community level, the interests of local construction companies and individual landowners often carry a lot of political weight. A higher-level perspective is lost as a result. Since decision-makers, especially in small communities, often lack an understanding of spatial planning interrelationships, coordination of settlement development, transportation and environmental protection is poor. Competition for good taxpayers and companies is also prompting municipalities and cantons to relax existing spatial planning regulations. Large plots of land in attractive locations are designated for prestigious projects. In rural areas, the wrong development in spatial planning is particularly visible. Structural changes in agriculture, large-scale tourism projects and the construction of second homes promote the softening of the separation between building and non-building areas and a constant expansion of building zones. In individual tourist communities, vacation homes and apartments account for over 80 percent (Laax, GR) of the total housing stock. To this end, the Lex Koller is already being gradually relaxed. In contrast, Swiss spatial planning fails to take into account the economically induced metropolization of Switzerland. We need better spatial planning. The high quality of life must be given high priority. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: the limitation of building zones. For the Greens, trading in land use certificates is a priority. strengthening spatial planning with the aim of minimizing infrastructure expenditure and the volume of traffic. The functions of use should be deliberately mixed for this purpose. Public-intensive facilities must not be built on greenfield sites. the protection of the agricultural zone and the preservation of productive land. a strict separation of construction and non-construction zones. The utilization rates in the building zones are to be increased in order to promote dense building. the strengthening of federal competence in spatial planning with the aim of strengthening coordination between the cantons and coherence with other policy areas (transport, agriculture). a spatial development concept for Switzerland that defines a balanced ratio of settled and open space. This must identify a few metropolitan areas, easily accessible centers and rural areas. The requirements for cantonal structure plans must be increased accordingly. the creation of a legal basis for agglomeration programs. The resources of the infrastructure fund should be linked to a high minimum share for public transport in the sense of steering. the expansion of train and bus connections, especially in the agglomerations and peripheral regions. Newly built neighborhoods must be connected to public transportation throughout. an active land and real estate policy by the public sector and public pension funds with the goal of maintaining and increasing a sufficient supply of affordable housing for people with low incomes. The preservation and sensible use of existing buildings should be prioritized over new construction at the expense of cultivated land. The harmonization of taxes in order to stop tax competition and thus the construction boom in low-tax locations. The retention of the Lex Koller or the introduction of accompanying measures in the event of its abolition, in order to put a stop to the construction of second homes and to tax the waste of energy through ""cold beds"". The promotion and support of a rural agriculture that preserves a scenically diverse and open living space for the population. The preservation and promotion of the diversity of habitats and the biodiversity in these habitats. The existing inventories must finally be implemented. The necessary funds must be provided by the federal government and the cantons. 1.4 Research and innovation - thinking tomorrow's world today The Greens stand for strong research at universities and universities of applied sciences. They attach just as much importance to applied research as to independent basic research. The two areas should cooperate more closely. Collaboration with practitioners should be planned into research programs from the outset, where possible. In contrast, a reorientation is needed in the prioritization of research. Significantly more resources are needed to promote sustainable living and economic practices. Research into resource-saving, innovative technologies (e.g. in the field of renewable energies) has a key role to play here. This also applies to research into life cycles, taking into account ecological and economic aspects. However, purely technology-centered research is misleading. The Greens therefore want to strengthen research in the humanities, social and cultural sciences, as well as gender research and peace and conflict research. Research for organic agriculture must also be strengthened. In return, research into non-sustainable technologies, for example nuclear research, should and can be dispensed with altogether. Research also entails risks for society and the environment. These must be minimized. The risks of new technologies must be precisely clarified for this purpose. Their application is to be regulated by the federal government in accordance with these clarifications. Research on living organisms must also be subject to ethical principles. For this reason, the Greens fundamentally reject the patenting of life. Patents for inventions and discoveries are useful, but no one can invent life. Measures to protect society are important to ensure that research is not conducted unilaterally in the interests of companies. Intellectual property may not be invoked to oppose the introduction of low-cost drugs in southern countries. Ethical considerations are also central for the Greens when it comes to research on humans. In the Human Research Act HFG, which is being debated in parliament, human dignity must take precedence over freedom of research. Research on persons incapable of giving consent, such as children, incapacitated and disabled persons, must not be carried out without the persons concerned benefiting directly from this research. Genetic engineering is also a particularly sensitive area. The clear acceptance of the GMO-free initiative in November 2005 shows that the population does not want to take any risks with genetic engineering innovations. The CHF 12 million research program on the benefits and risks of cultivating genetically modified plants is now to investigate how ecological, high-quality and GMO-free Swiss agriculture can be protected from genetic contamination. We recall that global nutrition is a problem of distribution, not of quantitative production. Genetic engineering in agriculture is not a solution to this challenge. Nanotechnology also has a special role to play. Nanotechnology involves the production and application of minute material structures (smaller than 100 millionths of a millimeter!) for medicine, cosmetics, households, agriculture and our food. Although more than 200 products are already on the market worldwide, the risks of this technology for humans and the environment are still largely unknown. They are to be clarified by the federal government by 2009, as requested by a motion of the Green Group in May 2006. If necessary, measures must be introduced to protect people and the environment. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: an increase in funding for education, research and innovation of 10% per year and the associated reorientation of research priorities towards sustainable development, in particular through the creation of corresponding chairs at the Federal Institutes of Technology. the promotion of cooperation between basic research, applied research and practice. a patent law that guarantees the protection of social concerns over the interests of industry. To this end, it must prohibit the patenting of life, contain measures against biopiracy, permit parallel imports and compulsory licensing, and consolidate the farmer's privilege. anchoring the protection of human dignity as the supreme constitutional principle of the state legal system. This applies in particular to the planned constitutional amendment to the Human Research Act. the consistent implementation of the regulations in the Genetic Engineering Act: The National Research Program 59 should lead to knowledge gains of risks with genetically engineered plants and not be misused for application trials. Likewise, a special protection status for the entire production and propagation of GMO-free seeds is to be achieved. To this end, the labeling limit for seeds is to be reduced from 0.5% today to 0.1%. steering the nanotechnology boom in an orderly manner. The Confederation must issue legal regulations on the term and scope of application, licensing procedures, toxicity and emission limits, measurement procedures, declaration regulations and liability issues. that the precautionary principle must be applied to every new technological development. 2. VOTING GREEN: FOR A SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY The Swiss economy has been experiencing an economic upswing again for just under two years. Contrary to the assertions of the bourgeoisie, the Swiss economy grows when the economy abroad is doing well. Consequently, Swiss economic policy has set the accents completely wrong in the past. Instead of tackling the burning problems of global environmental degradation and poverty, it has painted a black picture and prescribed growth programs. The effect of these programs: Switzerland has lost ground to neighboring countries in terms of environmental policy. The topic of the environment and the imperative ecological restructuring of the economy have clearly slipped to the back of the political agenda. As a result of direct tax relief and government austerity measures, poverty in Switzerland has increased. The new starting position must now be used to introduce the right measures. People who have been forced out of the labor market must be reintegrated. The ecological transformation of the economy must be tackled swiftly. Due to the prolonged economic downturn, there is a shortage of more than 250,000 jobs in Switzerland - for the approximately 180,000 unemployed and for people who work involuntary part-time jobs. Poverty must be combated: in wealthy Switzerland, around 13% of people of working age are classed as poor, half of whom are in gainful employment. What is needed is an increase in low wages, a fair tax policy, as well as income-related health insurance premiums and higher child allowances. Globally, the situation is much more worrying. In Africa, for example, nearly half the population has less than $1 a day to live on. The unequal distribution of resources has become more accentuated in recent decades. The per capita income gap between the richest and poorest countries is now around 20:1, compared with 13:1 in 1973. Switzerland, as a rich country, urgently needs to become more involved in development cooperation. The funds for development cooperation do not even reach the UN target of 0.7 percent of gross national income. At the same time as fighting poverty, the ecological transformation of the Swiss economy must be rapidly advanced. In ecological terms, the Swiss economy is decidedly inefficient. Over the past 15 years, for example, gross domestic product and energy consumption have grown almost in lockstep, even though resource efficiency could be increased by 2 percent annually. Measures must be taken at various levels. In terms of taxation, there needs to be a heavier burden on petroleum products - compared to neighboring countries, Swiss heating oil prices, but also gasoline prices, are clearly too low. Moreover, the economic damage caused by their consumption is not included in the price. An environmentally compatible transport and settlement policy and a pricing policy that integrates external costs are needed. The looming electricity supply gap must be closed by exploiting the huge savings potential that Switzerland has at its disposal. This is associated with the spread of new environmental technologies - also an opportunity for Swiss companies. 2.1 Driving forward the ecological transformation Natural resources are the indispensable basis for life and the economy. Without an intact environment, there can be no prosperity in the medium term. The economic benefits of environmental protection are expressed in improved quality of life and avoided costs. On October 30, 2006, former World Bank Chief Economist Nicholas Stern presented a report to the UK government on the costs of climate change. The report warns that inaction could cost the global economy 15 trillion francs. Stern shows that to stabilize CO2 emissions by 2050, one percent of annual global gross domestic product (GDP) would have to be invested in climate protection. Conversely, the report warns that inaction would cost the global economy dearly - the cost would be ""at least 5 percent"" of GDP and 20 percent in the worst case. The result could be economic crises comparable to those in the run-up to and after the world wars and in 1929. Stern concludes that governments must tax and regulate carbon emissions. The development of low-CO2 and very efficient technologies is also fundamental, he said. Environmental protection contributes to the gross domestic product. This amounts to almost 7 billion francs annually. This corresponds to around 61,000 full-time jobs. Nevertheless, economic growth today is unfortunately still at the expense of the environment. In particular, energy consumption is rising as GDP increases, although according to ETH Zurich it is already around three times higher than globally sustainable in Switzerland alone. More than three quarters of the energy we consume comes from non-renewable sources. The new renewable energies, on the other hand, do not even make it to one percent! In the long term, tens of thousands of new and permanent jobs can be created with economical and efficient energy use and with renewable energies. Germany is leading the way: Today, more people work together in our neighboring country in the fields of environmental technology and renewable energies than in the nuclear and coal industries. In the last ten years, 120,000 jobs have been created in the green power sector alone. If renewable energies continue to boom in our neighboring country, the number of jobs is expected to reach 400,000 in four years. But the energy transition has other economic benefits as well: it reduces health care costs, saves the economy and households billions in energy expenditures every year, and protects the climate and the air we breathe worldwide. Although energy is the key factor on the way to a sustainable economy, we also need ecological restructuring in other areas. Whether in agriculture, construction, mobility or the packaging industry, the future belongs to those companies that operate ecologically and produce energy-saving and recyclable goods. Blind economic growth burdens all environmental sectors. It promotes the ""concreting"" of the landscape, the pollution and overuse of our waters, and leads to mountains of waste. Companies largely base their strategies on the international financial markets. They think in short-term time frames. The environment thus has a vanishingly small status compared to profit maximization. Approaches to greening the economy must therefore necessarily take into account financial markets and global trade policies. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: the decoupling of economic growth and resource consumption. Technical innovation must be accelerated to achieve this. Environmental tax reform is the most effective tool to drive this change. The HVF and the VOC (volatile organic compounds) levy are charges in this sense. The CO2 tax must follow as quickly as possible. the rapid implementation of the polluter-pays principle. The coverage gap in the environmental sector still amounts to 9.7 billion Swiss francs per year. 2.2 billion of this is accounted for by waste disposal and pension costs alone. These costs must be borne by the polluters. Road pricing or land use certificates are sensible instruments for the areas of transport and spatial planning to implement the polluter-pays principle. a higher budget for research into innovative and environmentally friendly technologies. In return, subsidies for nuclear research may be eliminated. The only thing that needs to be done is to ensure that the safety controls and requirements of our ever aging nuclear power plants are not neglected public funds only for projects that are in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. Public contracts may only be awarded to companies that are committed to environmental and social sustainability. appropriate promotional instruments for environmentally friendly technologies. SwissEnergy should be increased to at least 100 million Swiss francs in this sense. an environmentally sound investment policy for cash reserves, especially in the area of social security (pension fund, AHV). a commitment by Switzerland to strengthening regional and local economic cycles, especially in agriculture. Healthy food deserves fair, preferably cost-covering prices and protection from undeclared imported cheap products. Only decentralized local food production can provide sufficient food for the world's population. The shortest possible transport distances and true costs in freight transport must also be recognized in international bodies such as the WTO. Cost truth in freight transport is the central instrument for implementing this principle. an agricultural policy that focuses on ecology, quality and animal welfare. Agriculture provides valuable and indispensable services to society: in addition to food production, it creates varied cultural landscapes, it contributes to the economic and social vitality of rural areas and it creates habitats for plants and animals. These services must be compensated by direct payments. At the same time, the requirements for the ecological performance certificate are to be increased. in order to stop the dying of farmers and the migration from rural areas, small and medium-sized farms are to be guaranteed a minimum income that ensures their existence. 2.2 A fair tax policy Swiss tax policy over the past 20 years has been dominated by tax cuts. The conservative parties have submitted countless proposals to the federal government, the cantons and the municipalities with the aim of lowering progressive direct taxes and increasing government revenues through degressive indirect taxes and fees. Although many of these initiatives were defeated (e.g. the referendum against the tax package), they nevertheless resulted in a redistribution to the disadvantage of lower incomes and to the benefit of higher incomes. From 1990 to 2001, the burden of a poor household (lowest 20%) with direct taxes and social security contributions increased by more than 2000 francs per year, while a rich household was relieved by 4300 francs. In addition, there are additional redistributive effects from the value-added tax and fees that are more difficult to quantify. The tax reduction measures were justified by the fact that they were unavoidable due to international and national tax competition. But tax cuts not only do not create new jobs; on the contrary, they exacerbate economic and social contradictions. It is a fact that the tax burden in Switzerland is only lower in Ireland in a European comparison. In the coming years, the aim will be to break this trend of placing a heavier burden on low incomes and a weaker one on high incomes. One effective starting point is to limit fiscal federalism. Tax dumping due to cantonal tax competition must be curbed by national regulation - for example, through tax rate floors. Intercantonal financial equalization is to be strengthened. Since the inheritance tax has been abolished or reduced in numerous cantons, a national inheritance tax is needed. This also makes sense from an economic point of view: Due to the rising average age of the population, assets are increasingly being bequeathed to people who have their retirement in sight, even though younger people would need the money more. This ""inheritance cycle"" between retirees and near-retirees could be curtailed. Energy from non-renewable resources is too cheap in Switzerland. On the one hand, heating oil and gasoline prices are lower compared to neighboring countries. On the other hand, they are too low from an economic point of view, since consumption is associated with external effects that are not included in the price (global warming and other environmental damage, but also damage to human health). Therefore, higher taxation is needed to internalize at least part of the external costs. This taxation could be designed as an incentive tax and be reimbursed via health insurance premiums, for example. If Switzerland were to raise its prices to EU levels (adjusted for purchasing power), health insurance premiums could be almost halved with the additional revenue. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: an ecological tax reform must be driven forward. individual taxation irrespective of marital status, as only such taxation takes account of social developments and provides a clear response to gender equality. a complete change in the system of residential property taxation: no more deductions for maintenance, mortgages, etc., but abolition of the imputed rental value. no flat-rate taxation of resident foreigners. the introduction of a national inheritance tax. Yes to the initiative ""For fair taxes. Stop the abuse of tax competition"". 2.3 Fair distribution of wealth In Switzerland, 20 percent of the population collects 50 percent of the total income. In terms of wealth, the distribution is even more unjust. 5 percent of the Swiss own 60 percent of the assets. Corporate profits are skyrocketing and managers in the executive suites are paying themselves fantasy salaries. On the other hand, depending on the estimate, there are around 250,000 people who cannot live on their earned income. More than 300,000 people are dependent on social assistance. These inequalities continue through retirement and into death. Thus, it is mainly high-earning professionals who retire early, while employees with lower incomes and less attractive jobs have to work until the statutory retirement age for financial reasons. What is more shocking is that their retirement is shorter than that of the wealthy, since they generally die earlier than the well-off. The contrast between rich and poor has become even more pronounced in the last 15 years. It is true, for example, that minimum wage campaigns on the labor market have brought about an improvement in the lowest wages. However, these successes in poverty reduction were thwarted by the aforementioned government tax and revenue policies. In addition, the long economic downturn has left clear traces. Underemployment has increased sharply since the early 1990s. Currently, Switzerland lacks more than 250,000 jobs to reach full employment. This is a particularly big problem with regard to school and apprenticeship graduates. They find it harder to gain a foothold in the labor market due to the lack of jobs. When the economy is good and corporate profits are soaring, managers award themselves pay increases of 10 percent and more. At the same time, they are reluctant to give workers wage increases of 1 percent. The ratio between the highest and lowest wages in Switzerland in 2005 was around 1:500 in certain cases! To put a stop to this rip-off, the Greens have decided to support the initiative ""against rip-off"". Great inequities exist between the sexes. This is striking in the case of wages, for example. Men earn on average about 1000 Fr. per month or 20 percent more than women! The latter also perform a considerably larger share of family and household work than men. Migrants are also discriminated against. They often work in less attractive professions, are much more frequently unemployed, have greater problems finding apprenticeships and earn significantly less than Swiss nationals with the same qualifications. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: a minimum wage of CHF 3,500 for all. equal pay for equal work or work of equal value. No privileged taxation of shareholdings or employee options. the limitation of the deductibility of retirement lump sums. the introduction of a capital gains tax and a foreign exchange transaction tax (Tobin tax). the abolition of per capita premiums for health insurance. the promotion of fair trade. 2.4 Work with dignity for all The last 15 years have been decidedly bad years for the Swiss workforce. Partly self-inflicted economic problems have played a major role in turning unemployment in Switzerland from an exceptional case into a permanent political issue. In 2005, 185,000 people were unemployed. In addition, there are more than 380,000 who would like to increase their workload. More than 150,000 people work in precarious jobs (e.g. on-call work). Many have dropped out of the labor market altogether due to mental health problems and ended up on IV. Overall, the number of IV pensions has increased by 100,000 to around 250,000 since 1990. A considerable share of the blame for this development lies with inconsiderate employers who have increased the pressure on their employees and failed to fulfill their obligations, e.g. with regard to health protection in the workplace, at the expense of the general public. The improved situation on the labor market must now be used to reduce underemployment in Switzerland and improve working conditions. In urban areas in Switzerland in particular, we have seen a significant increase in demand, regardless of the economic situation. development - structural unemployment. The long-term unemployed must therefore be offered further training and retraining opportunities. This is especially important for young unemployed people who have not completed any training. Employment opportunities in the second sector must be offered to the unemployed who cannot achieve new qualifications and be integrated into the labor market. (e.g. public employment programs). Great reintegration efforts are needed, as well as jobs for people who are not in full possession of their physical and mental powers. At the same time, employers must be held more accountable. Anyone who neglects health protection or who reduces staff at the expense of the general public despite good business performance should have to bear the financial consequences. The majority of unpaid work (domestic, family and voluntary work) is still done by women. Although numerous campaigns and initiatives have made a difference, there is still a long way to go to achieve a fair distribution of gainful and non-gainful employment. There is a need for further expansion of supplementary family care options as well as new working time models. The Greens call for a general reduction in working hours and a redistribution of gainful and non-gainful employment: future increases in labor productivity should be compensated for by more leisure time in the economy as a whole. This would have positive consequences in various areas. Men's participation in inactivity would be facilitated. The number of people in employment could be increased without the need for corresponding economic growth. This would facilitate ecological conversion and increase the quality of life. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: more apprenticeships for young people. the promotion of further training or retraining for women and men after having children. the redistribution of gainful and non-gainful employment. the introduction of quotas for jobs for partially disabled persons in companies. improving the working conditions of part-time employees: no discrimination in terms of social benefits, further training and promotions. Improvements in working conditions for migrants working in the semi-privatized service sector (especially domestic workers); promotion of the employment of young people and adults with a migration background in the administration and corresponding incentive systems for the private sector. No deterioration in working conditions for federal staff, no to performance-based wages. Training opportunities for unemployed young adults when needed. Creation of jobs in the second labor market for the long-term unemployed; specific measures for the qualification and reintegration of the unemployed over 50. Support for cantons with an above-average unemployment rate. 2.5 Ecological-social agriculture on our doorstep Switzerland's agricultural policy was reformed in the 1990s. Income policy was decoupled from price and sales guarantees. Since then, the constitution has contained specifications for sustainable and market-oriented production. Article 104 of the Federal Constitution lists the four tasks of agriculture: food security for the population, preservation of the natural basis of life, maintenance of the cultivated landscape, and decentralized settlement of the land. The Greens are committed to an ecological-social agricultural policy, especially the promotion of particularly environmentally and animal-friendly forms of production such as organic farming and free-range livestock. This strategy strives for the closest possible ties between consumers and farmers, an ""agriculture on our doorsteps."" The agricultural policy goals do not only apply to Switzerland. Internationally, the Greens are committed to the idea of ""food sovereignty."" Countries and peoples should independently determine their own policies that ensure adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs and promote regional economic cycles. The principles of fair trade must be established in the international exchange of goods, for example by dispensing with export subsidies and introducing minimum ecological and social standards. The Greens' commitment to ecological-social agricultural policy is based on the following insight: agriculture's services to nature and the environment have value. This value is not or only partially paid for when purchasing an agricultural product. So the compensation of the difference is done through the federal treasury. A good 3.5 billion Swiss francs per year are provided to farms in the form of direct payments, market support and investment aid. In return, consideration for farm animals and the environment is required. To prevent unlawful enrichment, contributions are graduated and income and asset limits apply. Green agricultural policy does not serve farm families alone. For society, vital interests are at stake: Direct payments are linked to an ecological performance record. The aim is to protect the environment from excessive use of fertilizers, chemicals and other auxiliary materials. For consumers, Swiss agricultural policy offers transparency above all. Declaration regulations on the origin, quality, production method and processing methods for food provide buyers in Switzerland with information and choice. Thanks to a moratorium, Swiss agriculture is also GMO-free. The agricultural reform is in danger of stumbling in the current stage. The Federal Council has geared agricultural policy 2011 (for the payment period 2008 to 2011) primarily to increasing competitiveness and is aiming for accelerated structural change: Larger farms are to generate better incomes. Massive pressure is coming from trade associations. In international negotiations, they demand the complete subordination of the agricultural sector to the trade interests of the export industry. This one-dimensional view of agricultural structure ignores the strengths of Swiss agriculture: high quality and naturalness of products, ecological performance, animal welfare and social aspects. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: The agricultural policy strategy should emphasize the high quality of food, organic and animal-friendly production methods and the renunciation of agro-genetic engineering. The agricultural sector should be recognized as a vital part of the economy and not be considered as a compensation mass for export interests in international agreements. Mountain farms and part-time farms must not be further discriminated against in direct payments and investment aid. Federal funds should be disbursed transparently to farms, and market supports should not be diverted as industrial protection. In the rural land and tenancy law, price control and protection of farms from fragmentation must not be relaxed. In international agreements and free trade treaties, Switzerland should commit itself to the idea of food sovereignty. 3. VOTING GREEN: FOR A COMMITTED SOCIAL POLICY All people have the right to live in a healthy environment with dignity and self-determination. We are a long way from this ideal, to which green politics aspires. Millions of people around the world lack the most basic necessities. Malnutrition, no clean drinking water, no access to paid work, to education and to health care are an expression of a world disorder in which the most basic human rights are systematically violated. Even in Switzerland, not all people can live in dignity and self-determination. Around 250,000 people cannot make ends meet on their income, and about 300,000 people receive social assistance. For many families with children, the financial situation is becoming increasingly difficult due to rising health insurance premiums, rents and other burdens. The new Foreigners and Asylum Laws make the situation of immigrants even more difficult. In addition, there are 100,000 to 300,000 people without papers (sanspapiers) who live and work in our country without residence and social rights and are exposed to the arbitrariness of authorities and employers. In our society, being fit and efficient is the name of the game. Those who do not meet this standard often quickly find themselves sidelined. It is no coincidence that the number of IV recipients has risen sharply in recent years. For people with disabilities or people with mental difficulties, there is less and less room in our economy, which is trimmed to ever more performance. For the Greens, it is clear that all people, regardless of gender, origin, religion and lifestyle, must have the same rights. But although this principle is also enshrined in the Federal Constitution, women are still disadvantaged in many ways. Not all children have equal educational opportunities, and people with impaired performance are marginalized. In order to ensure a decent existence for all people in Switzerland, we have social insurance and state resources. Social insurances and the public sector take over tasks that the individual cannot or can no longer guarantee him/herself. Anyone who is unemployed, ill, old or disabled, or who is temporarily unable to work due to maternity, civilian or military service, is dependent on good social insurance. And we are all glad to have well-functioning state structures that guarantee, for example, a quality education and health system, efficient rail and bus connections, and a flawless energy and drinking water supply. Unfortunately, social security and government benefits are under pressure today. Civic parties call for government services to be scaled down. Social security has been under constant attack for years under the pretext that it is too expensive. Parasites, bogus invalids, lazy unemployed, abuse are the buzzwords of those forces who want to limit public spending. Of course, the Greens want social insurance to be managed transparently and efficiently and public funds to be used wisely. But efficiency must not be an end in itself. The standard is the right of all children, women and men to live in dignity. 3.1 A secure existence and integration for all The guiding ideas of Green social policy include the following two principles: Self-determination of the individual, promotion of personal responsibility and participation Solidarity with the weaker and material security for all. This expresses that socio-political measures should not lead people into dependency, but should, as far as possible, (re)enable the independence and self-determination of those affected. At the same time, the second principle takes into account the fact that in our society many people, respectively all of us, are dependent on solidary support, for example when we are ill, old or unemployed. Years ago, the Greens already proposed to unify the social insurances. The various social insurance schemes generate high administrative costs, which can easily be reduced in a more efficient system. The social policy vision of the Greens includes a unification of the Swiss system of social security into a single comprehensive institution that ensures the material existence of all those who cannot afford wage employment: The unemployed, women in maternity, children, students, civil and military servants, the sick, the disabled and the elderly. Until that time comes, it is a matter of strengthening the social services in such a way that the social integration of those affected is guaranteed. As an important social welfare system, the AHV must be strengthened. Thanks to supplementary benefits for people with special needs, the elderly group is no longer affected by poverty. The AHV provides a good model for basic security for the other groups in our society as well. The IV is currently disabled itself. Waiting loops, during which those affected are condemned to inactivity, worsen with each passing day the chances of resuming a normal life despite disability. Everyone who has fallen ill or suffered an accident has the right to early diagnosis and support with the aim of rapid reintegration.  Families provide unpaid and unaffordable services that are of vital importance for today's and tomorrow's society. These achievements should be recognized with financial support and promoted with good framework conditions. It is shocking that children today are disproportionately affected by poverty. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: a basic living income for all. strengthening the AHV instead of expanding the second and third pillars, as only the first pillar meets the requirement of social justice. Yes to the initiative ""for a flexible retirement age"" of the Swiss Federation of Trade Unions. an efficient and financially secure IV: We support the principle: ""Integration before pension"". The procedures must be simplified and accelerated. The right to be accompanied by a constant specialist throughout the entire process promises cooperation and prevents duplication, unnecessary clarifications and waiting loops. Employers should be clearly held accountable, but also given incentives to employ sick employees in their company. We call for niche jobs and minimum quotas for the employment of people with reduced capacity in public administration and private employers. a family policy that takes account of social realities: Appropriate allowances for all children, regardless of the parents' professional status, entitlement to supplementary benefits for children in precarious circumstances, childcare structures that complement the family and flexible working models so that family and career are compatible for women and men. 3.2 More prevention and coordination in health policy The first concern of green health policy is to create healthy living conditions and to combat developments that endanger health. Healthy living conditions include, in particular, clean air, low noise, good living and working conditions, and a healthy diet. Careful treatment of nature and resource-conserving ways of living, working and doing business are basic prerequisites for maintaining healthy living conditions. Second, the Greens want good quality health care that is affordable for all. Today, this requires a high degree of coordination and public governance. Sick people should be able to count on good health care regardless of their social situation. The ongoing health insurance overhaul is tackling the issue at the wrong end. Instead of promoting new models of care and better treatment processes, the aim is simply to expand the range of providers who are allowed to operate at the expense of mandatory health insurance. Newly, profit-oriented private hospitals are also to be subsidized with public funds. Instead of finally tackling more social financing, responsibility is being shifted back and forth between health insurance companies and the cantons. The Greens were therefore at the forefront of the initiative for a social single health insurance fund, which also wanted a social equalization of financing. Today, the Swiss healthcare system costs more than 50 billion Swiss francs per year, or about 6,500 Swiss francs per capita of the population. Higher life expectancy and other demographic factors, as well as medical and technological advances, will tend to increase these costs. At the same time, however, there is potential for savings that would also allow cost growth to be stabilized or improvements to be made in areas such as Spitex: savings, for example, in the area of specialist doctors, in medicines and thanks to better coordination of hospital planning and care processes. Thus, with improved treatment processes, multiple examinations can be avoided. There also needs to be more transparency in compensation. Switzerland's healthcare system is still of high quality. To keep it that way and to ensure that services remain equally accessible and affordable for all, reforms are needed - green health reforms. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: strengthening prevention through the implementation of air and noise protection measures and through incentive taxes on harmful consumer goods such as tobacco and alcohol. Health promotion through organically and GMO-free produced food and exercise promotion. Funds from health insurance for health promotion in the workplace, for educational institutions and in the communities. the financing of complementary medicine from basic insurance, as envisaged by the initiative ""Yes to complementary medicine"". the restriction of smoking in public places. Measures for better coordination and savings: Formation of care regions across cantonal borders, federal competencies for the coordination of cutting-edge medicine, models that promote medical treatment in a holistic treatment process . Strengthening of family medicine: promotion of specific further training in family medicine at universities as well as among teaching physicians in practice. no reduction of the benefits catalog in basic insurance. fairer distribution of the burden: as long as capitation premiums have not been abolished, there needs to be a doubling of the current premium subsidies via the federal treasury in order to relieve the burden on low-income groups, families and middle-income earners. Improved risk equalization among health insurance companies, so that the hunt for low-cost insured persons stops (in case the initiative for a social single health insurance company is rejected) Further measures to reduce costs: Parallel imports of medicines, abolition of the obligation to contract for specialist doctors, limitation of the sometimes outrageously high incomes of chief physicians in hospitals Abolition of the provision (Art 64 KVG) that allows insurance companies to suspend the contract with insured persons who do not pay the premiums Retention and further development of the program for early detection of cancer diseases Solidarity-based financing of old-age care via the resources of health insurance, the cantons and municipalities, supplementary benefits or inheritance tax No old-age risk premiums or tax-privileged old-age care insurance. Decriminalization of drug use, controlled distribution, strengthening of prevention, especially among young people 3.3 Equality and equal opportunities Equal opportunity is the Green Party's program. There is enormous potential in our modern, pluralistic society that is wasted without an active equality policy. Everyone must have equal opportunities in access to education, training, employment and culture. No one shall be discriminated against on the grounds of gender, ethnic origin, religion or belief, sexual identity, age or disability. The Green Party is committed to ensuring that all minorities have the same rights as the rest of the population. With the adoption of the Partnership Act, the rights of homosexual couples have been recognized. But much remains to be done so that transsexuals and transvestites can also live their identity without discrimination. The Greens will work to ensure that appropriate legal foundations are created. We are committed to ensuring that women and men can realize their aspirations in their professional and family lives. This is also a challenge for business, for example by creating part-time positions for men and women at all levels of the hierarchy. Employers should create or financially support company childcare facilities, and family-friendly working time models are needed. For us, opportunities for women means opportunities for all women and recognition of their different life plans and biographies. We want women to be able to pursue their careers with confidence. Women should have the same opportunities for promotion and further training as men, even with part-time work and care responsibilities. We want young women to be able to study computer science and build solar cars. We want young men to become early childhood educators and fathers to be able to take paternity leave without being considered exotic. That is why we want the introduction of parental leave for fathers and mothers. We also need equal opportunities in education and culture. We stand for a school that integrates. We see a heterogeneous composition in schools as normality. The joy of learning and discovery requires ""heart, mind and hand"" at all levels of education and in all subjects. The school is to educate to maturity and moral courage, to promote the self and social competences as well as to enable creative, musical and social learning. From a Green perspective, participation in political decision-making that is appropriate for children and young people must be realized. The Green Party supports a strong and diverse cultural scene. Culture is a condition for a democratic society and a central dimension of a self-determined life. Therefore, it must be promoted even where it is not immediately profitable. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: equal pay for equal work and pay transparency so that women can sue for their pay. Employers must have their pay systems reviewed for discrimination. Public sector work contracts only to companies that have reviewed their wage structure with regard to discrimination against women. Measures to monitor application are to be set out in the Federal Gender Equality Act. the review of the gender equality-relevant impact of expenditure both in the private sector and in the administrations. In the area of social insurance: No discrimination against couples who both work part-time. Therefore: Only one coordination deduction on the salaries of couples working part-time. Block times at school and out-of-home childcare according to needs with lunch tables, crèches, day schools, etc. for children from 0 to 16 years of age. A voluntary offer with cost sharing is to be established in the municipalities. Childcare should be tax deductible. the promotion and introduction of paid paternity leave. the priority of the principle of integration and equal opportunities over the principle of selection in all schools. Children's and youth parliaments with right of petition. Same adoption rights for homosexual couples as for heterosexual ones. 3.4 A good quality public service By and large, Switzerland has good public services. Despite all the need for reform, it should be noted that we have a high-quality education and healthcare system. The state infrastructures for public transport, railroads, postal services, telecom, education, security, rescue, water and electricity function reliably and at a high level of quality. Government services are generally available to all residents of this state. Today, people are trying to convince us that we can no longer afford this care in a world that is spinning faster and faster. It is part of neoliberal ideology to discredit the state and to accuse public administrations of lack of efficiency and excessive costs. What is not mentioned is that Switzerland, with a government spending ratio of 38 percent of GDP (in 2005), is well below the average of the 15 old EU states. Here, the government spending ratio (share of government spending and social security funds in relation to gross domestic product) averaged 47.9 percent. From the Green point of view, the whining about tight public finances is an expression of wrong priorities. Year after year, 12 billion Swiss francs continue to be spent on the army and luxury solutions in road construction, while funds are not made available for important areas in environmental protection and public transport. According to OECD statistics, Switzerland today has the lowest overall tax burden of all OECD countries in relation to gross domestic product. But she wants to do even better. Corporate Tax Reform II, a uniform rate of value-added tax, and a flat tax (uniform tax rate for individuals) are the keywords for projects that envisage further tax cuts from which the rich in particular will benefit. These tax-cutting projects are accompanied by austerity programs. With the so-called relief programs 03 and 04, around 25,000 jobs will disappear. As a result, the scope for action of the federal government, cantons and municipalities is shrinking more and more. The Greens are definitely in favor of economical and efficient use of public (tax) money. However, this must not be allowed to jeopardize good quality service in healthcare, education, postal services, public transport, security and rescue, and electricity and water supply. This is especially true for the peripheral regions. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: increasing the credits for education and research so that the legal requirements for universities of applied sciences can be met, particularly in the areas of health, social affairs and art. Strengthening of vocational training by the federal government; massive expansion of public transport, especially in conurbations. Enough staff to provide good customer service and safety. Reducing the price of public transport season tickets. Good public transport connections, closing the mobility chains and alternative services such as call buses for the peripheral regions. Water must be protected as a public good and prevented from being privatized. higher investments for environmental protection and disaster prevention. an electricity supply law that promotes renewable energies and guarantees security of supply. The high-voltage networks and local supply must remain in public hands. no sale of Swisscom. As the majority shareholder, the federal government should be the guarantor and motor that sensible new technologies are introduced quickly and made accessible to all; Post and Postfinance and the SBB must remain state-owned enterprises. Tasks of internal security (police) and in the area of rescue services (fire department, ambulance) must remain in public hands. 3.5 Fundamental rights and democracy The validity of basic democratic rights for all is one of the fundamental concerns of Green politics. But under the pretext of fighting terrorism, crime and violence, state surveillance and the restriction of central fundamental rights have been stepped up for several years. While the repressive apparatus and data collections have been massively expanded, the office of the Federal Data Protection Commissioner remains understaffed. As was the case before the Fichenscandal, the State Security Service records and monitors individuals and organizations that are not suspected of any crime. The number of new, now electronic, fiches already exceeded the limit of 60,000 in 2004. With a further tightening of the State Protection Act (Federal Act on Measures to Safeguard Internal Security - BWIS), the Service for Analysis and Prevention (DAP) is not only to be given the possibility of issuing activity bans, but also to be provided with powers for ""special information gathering"". He should be allowed - without any suspicion of crime - to monitor phones and e-mails, set bugs and hack into private computers. For the Greens, it is clear that security is not possible in a democratic society without legal certainty and without the binding validity of fundamental rights for all members of society. This applies not only where the state uses coercive measures to invade private spaces or monitor communication behavior on the Internet, but also where it deprives undesirable groups of people (""scenes"") of their freedom of movement and assembly. Expulsion paragraphs and begging bans, video surveillance and the use of private security services in public spaces do not protect citizens from violence. Their main purpose is to ensure consumerism and commercialism in city centers and train stations. This repression disguised as prevention is not only practiced by cantons and municipalities, but also by the federal government with the revision of the Railway Police Act and the strengthening and generalization of video surveillance. The federal government also supports the municipalities and cantons in enforcing the increasingly frequent bans on demonstrations: The DAP regularly assumes a coordinating role for major events, and the army is increasingly deployed for civil affairs (WEF, Euro 08). In addition, the Federal Council and the authorities use a great deal of PR to influence the results of referendums. Against this tendency toward the executive state, the Greens defend parliamentary influence and thus public debate. We fight against the militarization of ""internal security"", we stand up for the democratic freedoms of all, for consistent data protection and a real right to informational self-determination. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: Stop the expansion of state security and the militarization of ""internal security"". Opposition to a repressive expulsion policy through expulsion articles and district bans. Support measures and projects that promote mutual understanding, tolerance and respect. Resistance to all attempts to restrict the use of public spaces in favor of private commercial interests during Euro 08. Data protection through regulations and controls that prevent the aggregation of data which, in their context, may allow an overall view of individuals. No expansion of the BWIS and the powers of intelligence services such as the DAP. No enshrinement of ""hooligan legislation at the constitutional level. Measures to ensure the free flow of information on the Internet. The authorities' duty of neutrality in elections and votes. Guarantee of uniform dissemination of the various points of view prior to elections and votes in the public service media. 4. VOTING GREEN: FOR GLOBAL JUSTICE Among the greatest problems facing humanity, we count the following three: the militarization of politics, which in turn is linked to the main cause of global warming: dependence on fossil fuels; the gigantic wealth gap between North and South and within most states themselves; global warming, which will have dramatic ecological, social and political consequences. About 900 million people are severely and chronically malnourished. According to calculations by the World Food Organization (WHO), world agriculture could feed 12 billion people at the current level of productivity. Already, in addition to the millions of political and poverty refugees, there are some 250 million ecological refugees displaced by drought, devastation, and flooding. If global warming is not halted, sea levels will rise and weather extremes will increase to such an extent that countless islands, coastal and riverine areas will be submerged and vast areas of land will dry up. The Pentagon is already preparing militarily for the resulting migrations. We Greens are in favor of civil, i.e. social, ecological, political and humanitarian solutions. At the same time, we are aware that Switzerland is both a perpetrator and a victim of these global undesirable developments. The prosperity gap is not exclusively, but mainly the historical consequence of colonialism and imperialism, which - without the help of the rich Northwest of this planet - represent an insurmountable mortgage for the so-called Third World. The exploitation of people and the plundering of natural resources by the multinational, including Swiss, commodity, food, financial and other corporations continues. Here are two examples: The Zug-based commodities team Glencore/Xstrata is participating in the mining of the surface coal beds of El Cerrejon in Colombia together with the mining multinationals Anglo-American and BHP Billiton. This mining is associated with the contamination of water, air and people, with the destruction of indigenous communities and the displacement of previous inhabitants - by the army, police, paramilitaries and factory guards. The banking secrecy, more precisely: the impunity of tax evasion, the tax havens and the tax privileges for the rich and multinationals lead to the Third World losing huge sums of money every year, which would be urgently needed for health and education. According to an estimate by the British development organization Oxfam, the so-called developing countries lose 15 billion dollars a year through lost tax and asset revenues alone. One third of the world's money invested abroad by private individuals from the South is in Switzerland. We Greens are aware that part of the wealth of our country, which is mainly in the hands of a small minority, is based on the exploitation of the poorest. That is why we are committed to combating and punishing tax evasion, opposing tax privileges and tax dumping, expanding development cooperation, introducing a currency transaction tax (Tobin Tax) that can be used to fight poverty, and pursuing an economic foreign policy that is oriented not to the interests of multinationals but to those of the world's poorest. Switzerland should push for effective regulation of international financial markets and for trade rules that are tailored to the needs of national economies and that focus on the preservation of natural and social livelihoods. The combination of global solidarity, ecology and peace policy is the answer to the great challenges. Global ""Green Peace"" is our commitment and our identity. 4.1 Integrate foreigners, respect human rights Migration has been taking place for centuries and will continue to do so in times of globalization. The majority of people do not leave their homes voluntarily. It is a lack of economic or political prospects, wars, hunger, poverty or ecological disasters that cause people to take this step. In the North, it is the economic centers that recruit migrants because they depend on a reservoir of cheap and flexible labor. Migrants have also helped shape our country and participated in adding value to our economy. As long as the gap between rich and poor countries remains and as long as human rights are disregarded in countries, many people will have no choice but to leave their homes. Switzerland is also affected by migration. As a former country of emigration, it has become - at least since the middle of the last century - a country of immigration. It is necessary to accept and shape this reality. In the Green Party's view, constructive migration policy and an active development and human rights policy are equivalent instruments. The existing laws, the recently revised Asylum Act and the new Aliens Act, are anything but suitable instruments to take this reality into account. Both laws are characterized by the spirit of deterrence and exclusion. They do not prevent migration, but create new discrimination and injustice. A constructive migration policy implies that all persons, regardless of their origin and professional qualifications, should be able to settle in Switzerland if they can show that they have a job. This means that Switzerland will extend the free movement of persons, which currently applies to the EU, to all citizens worldwide. Accompanying labor law and social policy measures to prevent wage discrimination and wage dumping are indispensable. Employers, the state and society are also called upon to contribute to the integration of people living in Switzerland by taking appropriate measures. In addition to job seekers, refugees will continue to arrive in Switzerland in the future. The primary goal of Swiss refugee policy must be to identify those in need of protection and to protect them effectively from persecution. Procedures must comply with human rights and international and European conventions. But shaping a constructive migration policy in Switzerland is not enough! With increased development cooperation and an active international peace policy, Switzerland, as one of the richest countries in the world, must assume its responsibility and make its contribution to combating the causes of global migration. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: a migration law that puts people from within the EU on an equal footing with people from the rest of the world. Those who can show proof of a job should also receive a residence permit. uniform procedures for naturalizations throughout Switzerland. The right to naturalization must become enforceable after at least 8 years. The second generation of migrants should be facilitated and the third generation should be automatically naturalized. Naturalization decisions made by the authorities transparently and in compliance with the principles of the rule of law. Naturalization at the ballot box is out of the question for the Greens! the right to vote at the municipal and cantonal level for migrants who have been living in Switzerland for five years. the regularization of undocumented migrants (Sans-Papiers) on the basis of uniform and binding criteria . financial resources for the integration of migrants, as provided for in the new Foreign Nationals Act. consistent compliance with the anti-racism penal code. a factual information policy by the federal government in the face of fear-mongering by right-wing populist circles. 4.2 A sustainable foreign trade economy Which globalization is sustainable? This question is at the heart of the Swiss Greens' foreign trade and development policy. The term globalization stands for the overcoming of cultural and political borders. This process has accelerated enormously in recent decades as a result of groundbreaking technological developments in communications and transportation. Finances and goods flow more abundantly and quickly today. This development is largely due to political decisions known as liberalization. In the interests of their large corporations, the industrialized nations are driving this development. Economic globalization strongly influences social and political events in all countries and leaves irreversible traces in nature. In the southern countries, the effects are particularly dramatic. Developing countries lose billions of dollars in revenue to tax evasion and international tax competition alone. The gap between rich and poor is widening as a result of globalization, both domestically and between North and South. According to the 2000 UN Development Report, 12 percent of the world's population has 86 percent of the world's wealth. In addition, there is the overexploitation of nature, resource depletion through maximization of consumption and a massive increase in freight traffic. The Greens support the protest and resistance against the neoliberal globalization of the economy. They advocate for an ecologically sustainable, socially just and democratically controlled economy. The goal of business should not be unilaterally to maximize profit. Economic activities should serve the welfare of all while respecting ecological limits. The Greens are therefore focusing on deepening their own domestic markets and on regional market integration. The North-South divide and social inequalities must be reduced, the commercialization of all areas of life must be curbed, and democratic influence on foreign policy decisions must be strengthened To achieve this goal, efforts are needed at all levels. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: an increase in funding for development cooperation to 0.7 percent of GDP and generous debt relief for poor countries. Swiss foreign trade that requires all partner countries to respect human rights and democracy. the abolition of export subsidies in agriculture. no export risk guarantee for non-sustainable projects such as the construction of the Illisu dam. the lifting of banking secrecy for flight money and tax evasion and the obligation to provide legal assistance. a visible commitment by Switzerland to: new rules for globalization so that all countries have the right to protect their sensitive sectors. the democratization of foreign policy and intergovernmental decisions. a multilateral structure under the auspices of the UN, in which economic, socio-political and ecological interests are weighed against each other. To this end, the Bretton Woods institutions (WTO, World Bank, Monetary Fund), which are biased toward economic policy, must be integrated into the UN and reformed in favor of sustainable development. As a counterweight to the economic institutions, a global environmental organization must be created within the framework of the UN. the regulation of international financial markets, for example through a foreign exchange transaction tax (Tobin tax); an international agreement on the responsibility and liability of multi-national companies; the introduction of an international solidarity contribution on airline tickets. 4.3 An active peace policy In 2005, $1118 billion was spent on armaments and military worldwide. The USA accounts for almost half of this expenditure. By contrast, according to the World Bank, ""only"" $40 billion to $60 billion would be needed to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals and halve world poverty. The steep growth in war spending in recent years is a consequence of the war on terror led by the United States. However, this war is ultimately about much more. The real goal is to control the important raw material regions and routes as well as the key strategic areas of this world. NATO is also pursuing this goal. It was transformed from a defensive to an offensive alliance for this purpose after the Kosovo war. The forced build-up of European intervention forces is a push in the same direction. The ""war on terrorism"" stigmatizes Islam as a new universal enemy. The conflict in the Middle East feeds this phenomenon and prevents negotiations for a just and lasting peace. Knowing that border defense is basically out of step with the times, the Federal Council is trying to turn the Swiss army into a kind of federal police force and expand foreign missions. The Green Party of Switzerland supported the second army abolition initiative in 2001. The Greens still stand by their central concerns: Switzerland does not need an army, especially not for domestic missions. Instead, it should work internationally for nonviolent conflict resolution and for an environmentally sound and equitable distribution of natural resources. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: the condemnation of all violations of human rights and international law by Switzerland regardless of special economic, political or military interests. Switzerland sees its role as guardian of the Geneva Conventions as a mandate and perceives neutrality as an opportunity to stand up internationally for the strength of the law, and thus against the law of the strongest. Switzerland's renunciation of any arms cooperation and military cooperation with all armies that violate international law and participate in the ""war on terror"". This also has a preventive effect against terrorist attacks. Switzerland's current close cooperation with NATO (strategic planning, joint maneuvers) within the framework of the so-called ""Partnership for Peace"" must be stopped. a strong Swiss commitment to civil solutions to violent conflicts abroad and at home through active diplomacy, the expansion of development cooperation, the creation of a voluntary peace and social service and the renunciation of arms exports. The Greens have therefore co-launched the initiative for a ban on war material exports, because Switzerland should no longer earn money from the war business. a military standstill, a civilian pause for reflection and a financial arms moratorium due to the deep orientation crisis of the army. The misuse of the armed forces for internal security tasks must be strictly combated. The Swiss army should ultimately be replaced by the promotion of peace, justice and tolerance outside as well as within its own borders. a visible commitment by Switzerland to strengthen the UN and against any relativization of the UN mandate or the UN ban on war. The only institution legitimized to use force to defend human rights is the UN. 4.4 Towards a green Europe -with Switzerland The Greens decided back in 1998 that Switzerland should join the EU. Switzerland going it alone makes no sense. The unification of Europe and the prevention of new wars alone is a great achievement of the EU, which justifies its existence. However, in order to play a positive role in the world, Europe still has a lot to change: the EU must become more democratic and decentralized, it must give greater weight to social and ecological concerns and move away from its neoliberal course. Switzerland has some prerequisites to play a positive role in the necessary reforms. This is especially true in the area of democracy and subsidiarity. The Swiss Greens could work with the European Greens for reforms in this area. The world needs a strong and united Europe, Europe as a pacifist, cultural, ecological and tolerant pool. The Green Party of Switzerland believes that only full accession would allow Switzerland to help shape such a Europe as a true partner. In order for the Swiss population to be able to vote on EU accession in the foreseeable future, negotiations with the EU should be started now. Switzerland must enter the negotiations with clear conditions and guard rails. This requires transparent, open debates on the effects of accession in advance. Opening accession negotiations does not mean ""buying a pig in a poke"". Instead, it means finally taking concrete steps towards the EU and offering the Swiss people a real choice. There are areas that are sensitive in Switzerland or where the handling in this country is far more progressive than that of the EU. The Greens also do not want to simply give up direct democratic achievements in the event of EU accession. On the contrary, these areas must be protected in a binding manner beyond accession. Negotiations for Switzerland's accession to the EU must include the following points in particular: People's rights must not be restricted by EU accession. The Greens call for precise analyses of which areas would be affected by accession. Switzerland would have to advocate EU-wide popular rights, such as the European motion, the European referendum and the constructive referendum. Switzerland's neutrality must be preserved beyond EU accession. Switzerland's participation in an EU defense policy is out of the question for the Swiss Greens. Direct democratic achievements in the transport sector, such as the HVF and the Alpine Initiative, but also the moratorium on genetic engineering and the Lex Koller must be preserved beyond EU accession. The common agricultural policy is a central component of the EU. Switzerland must negotiate generous transitional periods in favor of a producing Swiss agriculture and already increasingly focus on organic and GMO-free production. It is imperative that Switzerland retain its autonomy in the amount and type of direct payments in agriculture. In the event of EU accession, the value-added tax in Switzerland would have to be increased from 7.6 percent today to 15 percent. It is essential to compensate for this massive increase. The VAT increase should also be staggered with a generous transition period. According to the Europe Report, EU accession costs amount to around CHF 3.4 billion annually. The federal budget should finance the costs of accession in such a way that the beneficiaries of accession cover the lion's share of the costs. The demands of the Greens for EU accession must not be undermined even before the accession negotiations by a submissive following of problematic EU regulations (e.g. Cassis de Dijon principle)."
43110,201110,"Nature has to serve for many things: It is the basis of life and habitat for countless life forms, produces food and raw materials, serves for recreation and it is increasingly abused as a waste disposal site. Especially the common way of energy production and mobility leave deep impacts on the environment and damage the climate. The Greens are taking countermeasures, with the goal of a 2000-watt society. They propagate a clean, i.e. non-polluting and safe energy supply, moderate mobility and a careful treatment of nature that ensures healthy diversity. 1.1 Green power, no nuclear Nuclear power plants are expensive, dangerous and completely obsolete. If the costs of covering the risks of a serious accident that could occur at any time were added to the price of electricity, a kilowatt-hour of nuclear power would cost several francs. But the risk is borne by the people. No long-term solution has been found for the safe storage of radioactive waste, even after 50 years and millions of dollars of searching. If one considers the entire CO2 balance from uranium mining to final disposal, nuclear power plants are unsuitable for mitigating global warming. Nuclear power plants make Switzerland dependent on uranium imports from extremely dubious sources. If the billions of francs planned for new nuclear power plants were invested in the construction of a decentralized, renewable energy supply, this would not only result in twice as much electricity, but also in massively higher CO2 savings and tens of thousands of jobs. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: Energy saving and energy efficiency : An active energy saving policy, with the aim of reducing energy consumption. Mandatory requirements for maximum consumption of motors and devices. With the ""Top Runner Principle"", these minimum requirements are continuously reviewed and raised. Stricter requirements for appliances in terms of energy consumption and minimum service life, as well as a ban on direct electric heaters. Energy label on all consumer goods, providing information on the gray energy for production, transport and disposal. Green power: An energy supply based exclusively on renewable energies from 2050. The doubling of the cost-covering feed-in tariff from 0.9 to 1.8 centimes per kilowatt hour. Smart grids to accommodate decentralized electricity production. The consideration of non-material concerns such as landscape protection, noise or biodiversity in the promotion of renewable energies and the corresponding adjustment of remuneration rates. Better connection to the European electricity market by making Switzerland's pumped storage capacity available for wind energy from the north and solar energy from the south. In return, investment security for wind and solar plants in Germany must be improved. Requiring energy companies not to invest in power generation from non-renewable energy abroad. If all these investments planned today were realized, they would cause several times the CO2 emissions of Switzerland today. The separate declaration by Swiss energy suppliers of electricity imports originating from non-renewable energy sources. Stop Atom: Nuclear phase-out by 2029. No extension of the operating license for the Mühleberg nuclear power plant. Nuclear waste repositories can only be planned once the nuclear phase-out has been decided. Funding, strict controls and retrievability of waste must be secured. The selection process for new camps must be transparent and the affected population must be consulted. In addition, there needs to be a guarantee of the cantons' right of co-determination. Full risk liability for nuclear power plants by their operators. 1.2 Climate protection Over the last 650,000 years, the CO2 concentration has always been below 0.28 per mille; humans have increased it to 0.39 per mille in less than 100 years. The negative effects of global warming are exacerbating conflicts and pressures on nature. In Switzerland, too, fossil fuels (oil, gas and coal) account for 70 percent of energy supply and 80 percent of climate pollution. But easily tapped oil reserves are running low, while global energy demand is rising. The search for new fossil energy reserves is becoming increasingly adventurous and risky, in most cases at the expense of the local, often indigenous population and with great damage to the environment. To minimize the risks to current or future generations, rapid and effective policy action is essential, with three main strategies: energy efficiency, sufficiency, and clean renewable energy. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: Reduction of greenhouse gases: In line with the Green Party's climate initiative, a reduction of CO2 emissions in Switzerland by 30 percent by 2020 compared to 1990. The CO2 tax on fuels must be raised, and the tax on all fuels must be introduced immediately at the full cost rate. Fuel tariffs are to be increased significantly; at the very least, prices should reach the level of neighboring countries. Improving new car efficiency for internal combustion engines to a maximum of 85g CO2 per kilometer by 2020. The goal is efficient zero-emission vehicles. For electric vehicles, it must be ensured that the electricity comes from clean renewable sources. At least Minergie-P-Eco or comparable performance values according to current building biology findings for new buildings by 2020 as mandatory and incentives for corresponding renovations of old buildings. The promotion of positive energy houses thanks to the building program. In the case of heating, energy consumption is to be halved and greenhouse gas emissions reduced by two-thirds. This requires national regulations for building insulation. Direct electric heaters must be banned and replaced. Research: The further development of technologies such as geothermal energy and energy storage systems and the assessment of their risks and benefits. In-depth research on how existing and new technologies can achieve climate and environmental goals. Promoting research into how biomass that is not fit for food can be used as an energy source. To promote research into the widespread use of cogeneration units. 1.3 Environmentally friendly transport Transport is the only sector in which CO2 emissions continue to rise unabated. Traffic growth is reaching its limits and must be replaced by a targeted policy of traffic avoidance. Spatial planning, economic policy and tax measures must be taken to ensure that the distances between living, working, shopping and leisure time become shorter again. For decades, Switzerland invested unilaterally in road expansion and neglected the rail network. Around three billion a year is spent on public transport, while road transport has uncovered environmental and health costs of around eight billion a year. These costs must be borne entirely by road users in the medium term. There is no shortage of approaches and proposals for solutions. However, they are so one-sided that they do not alleviate the situation on the roads. Despite Alptransit and the heavy goods vehicle tax, the shift of freight traffic to rail is still a long way off, and the construction of a second tube at the Gotthard continues to call the shift target into question. Modern rolling stock is urgently needed to boost freight rail transport, just as the railroads have done for passenger transport. Dwindling world oil supplies and rising fuel prices are opportunities for rail transport. Those who adjust accordingly will have an economic advantage in the future. Pedestrians and cyclists are also road users. A number of municipalities and cantons have recognized this and are contributing to their safety with targeted measures. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: To finance public transport, the following measures are to be examined or implemented: the continuation of value-added tax, road pricing, an adjustment of the HVF, an increase in the cost of the freeway toll sticker and mobility pricing. The Green Party supports the Public Transportation Initiative, which calls for 50 percent of the money from the excise tax on fuel to be used for public transportation infrastructure instead of 25 percent. The accessibility of all regions by public transport must be maintained. Amendments to road traffic legislation (SVG and VRV) to promote non-motorized traffic: Establishment of bicycle lanes in the main road network; general permission for cyclists to turn right on red; minimum width for sidewalks; reduced waiting time for pedestrians. Federal support of new agglomeration programs, with the aim of creating an incentive for the construction of bicycle and pedestrian paths. Before further increasing public transport fares, road transport should pay for its true costs (by increasing fuel tax, CO2 levy on fuels, road pricing). Rail 2030 planning should be guided by the goal of shifting passenger and freight traffic and avoiding additional traffic. A national, if possible international, coordinated Alpine transit exchange for freight transports. Cargo shuttle trains (freight commuter trains) should be encouraged. This innovative technology increases the attractiveness of rail freight transport. The renovation of the Gotthard tunnel must happen without a second tube and represent an opportunity for relocation. International rail connections must be expanded. Air traffic should pay for its own environmental and safety costs according to the polluter-pays principle. The Greens reject public financing of air transport. 1.4 Biodiversity An intact environment is the basis of life for plants, animals and humans, a great diversity of species the basis for a stable ecosystem. The Red Lists show that more and more species are endangered. Only just 2.2 percent of Switzerland's land area is located in protected areas under federal law, established for the conservation of important species and their habitats. Peatlands, floodplains and dry meadows are protected by law, but hardly in practice. Trend sports and winter sports are increasingly encroaching on previously inaccessible and undisturbed habitats and landscapes. Watercourses are also under pressure. There is no space for ecologically valuable riparian zones, and the few attractive riparian areas are claimed by agriculture, energy production, and recreationists. Implementation of the residual water regulations is proceeding very slowly. For the following legislature, the Greens demand: A comprehensive biodiversity strategy with effective instruments and sufficient financial and human resources, covering all policy areas, especially agriculture, spatial planning and tourism. This includes the renaturation of biotopes and canalized watercourses as well as interconnections that favor biodiversity, and the continuation of efforts to reduce air and water pollution. The examination of new funding options: Increasing the share from general funds, establishing an earmarked sealing fee, and revenue from fines for failure to meet minimum legal conservation requirements. For parks of national importance, quantitative and qualitative minimum requirements for natural and landscape values must be formulated. A network of natural islands must also be secured in intensively used land and in settlement areas. A federal commitment to long-term management, coordinated with the Council of Europe, for the protection of large carnivores with the goal of area-wide distribution and the possibility of reproduction. Increased federal encouragement and financial support - including from the Federal Office of Agriculture - for sheep herding and flock protection. The concretization of the legal requirement for near-natural silviculture through the formulation of minimum requirements that apply across the board, as well as the designation of forest reserves, including on the Central Plateau. The increasing number of calls for softening forest legislation must be resolutely opposed. The existing provisions for the protection of biodiversity must be enforced in a timely and consistent manner. This mainly concerns the implementation of the existing and new biotope inventories (bogs, floodplains, dry meadows). To this end, the federal government must provide greater support to the cantons, make sufficient financial resources available, subject to conditions, and monitor implementation. Furthermore, the remediation measures prescribed in the Water Protection Act must not be undermined by hastily approved hydropower projects. 2. economy and finance Money not only rules the world, money can destroy the world or shape it in such a way that its inhabitants can develop in a moderate way. The strong worldwide interconnectedness of economy and finance make global strategies necessary, while each country is challenged to orient these areas in an ecologically and socially compatible way. The Greens focus on values that outlast the fiscal year, values like responsibility and solidarity. Especially in business and finance, greater transparency and a return to sensible measures are urgently needed. 2.1 Ecological restructuring of the economy Although the three Swiss economic stimulus packages provide for investments in the environmental sector, overcoming the global multi-crisis (financial, climate, food and biodiversity crises) requires a far-reaching structural change in the economy and society in accordance with the principles of sustainable development: the time has come for society to agree on upper limits for needs - in the sense of the sufficiency economy (""décroissance""). The yardstick should not be ""more and more"", but the question of what is beneficial to people and the environment. The ecological restructuring of the economy in the sense of a ""Green New Deal"" creates jobs in sustainable industries with a promising future and strengthens the competitiveness of Switzerland as a business location. Economic growth must be decoupled from resource consumption, and the consumption of raw materials from the manufacture of products to their disposal must be significantly reduced. The principle ""who pollutes, pays"" (polluter pays principle) should apply to all. In addition to familiar instruments (taxation of resource consumption, bans on particularly harmful products or processes), this moderate green economy also needs innovative measures such as incentive systems for sustainable sectors and socially and environmentally responsible companies. At the international level, the principles of sustainable development must be integrated into bilateral and multilateral agreements and then implemented. For the ecological transformation of the economy, the Greens demand: A coherent and long-term sustainability strategy. At the beginning of each legislative term, the federal government defines the goals for a sustainable and resource-efficient economy for the next four years, including industry targets. Particular attention must be paid to the durability, reparability, reusability and recyclability of the initial products, and to ensuring that as few materials as possible are used that are hazardous to health, harmful to the environment or rare. Positive tax incentives and other incentive measures for particularly sustainable products and companies, as well as for companies that are willing to ecologically improve their manufacturing processes and/or their products as well as their disposal. The ongoing adaptation of environmental standards in Switzerland to more stringent standards abroad in accordance with the ""best regulatory practice"" principle. Eco-loans for young companies and start-ups in the new green markets. Strict sustainability indicators in economic development and public procurement. Examining the development potential of product-service systems such as car-sharing and developing a funding strategy. Improving information for consumers on the sustainability of products, for example by means of a label for durability and ease of repair. Negative tax incentives for unsustainably produced and disposable consumer products in the luxury goods sector. 2.2 A Green Agricultural Policy for the Future Only agriculture that works with nature has a future. In order to maintain fertility and diversity, to counter hunger and misery worldwide, we need peasant agriculture, as described in the UN World Agriculture Report. Free trade in agriculture is destroying farming structures and national markets all over the world. It turns agricultural products and, more recently, fertile farmland into speculative objects and global market commodities. The winners are usually industry and the rich North, the losers the local population, farming families and a country's self-sufficiency. This is why the global call for ""food sovereignty"" is becoming louder and louder. The food crises of the past few years have made it drastically clear to us: When borders are open, even food follows money. In Switzerland, too, agriculture is facing important decisions. Farming families are wrestling with the collapse in milk prices, Parliament is dealing with the realignment of direct payments and agricultural policy 2014-17, and the Federal Council is negotiating an agricultural free trade agreement with the EU. Sustainable production, gentle processing in the region and short transport routes are an important contribution to environmental and climate protection and bring added value for everyone. For the next legislature, the Greens demand: The preservation of a strong and diversified farming sector, capable of fulfilling the ecological tasks of modern agriculture. Food sovereignty instead of free trade: A binding quality strategy with all actors in the value chain against the creeping opening of agricultural markets. An action plan to increase organic farming to at least 20 percent of farmland. The consistent promotion of indigenous breeding and propagation of organic seeds. Fair prices and direct payments geared to sustainability and biodiversity, as well as the promotion of promising niche products in agriculture. Promoting climate-friendly food produced and processed in the region, for example through an energy label on food products. Incentives for moderate meat and fish consumption. Shifting agricultural subsidies away from animal-based toward more plant-based and organic food production. After the expiration of the GMO moratorium, the anchoring of GMO-free agriculture in the Agriculture Act. Combating the dependence of farmers worldwide on agricultural corporations through patented genetically modified seeds. The abandonment of agrofuels that compete with food production. No export subsidies on agricultural products, especially if they go to developing countries. 2.3 Spatial planning Switzerland is becoming overbuilt: Almost one square meter of green space per second - around ten soccer fields every day - is disappearing under roads, shopping centers, parking lots and houses. Eleven hectares of cultivated land are lost every day, and the trend is still rising. Settlements are growing unchecked into the landscape. Outside the villages and cities, urban sprawl continues to increase. Population growth and increased demand for land are partly responsible for this development. However, the main cause lies in the massive enforcement deficit in spatial planning. According to the 2007 building zone statistics of the Federal Office for Spatial Development, there are currently between 38,000 and 53,000 hectares of building land in Switzerland that have not yet been built over. These building land reserves offer space for approximately 1.4 to 2.1 million people. In addition, there are 1820 hectares of industrial, military and railroad land that lie fallow and provide space for several 10,000 jobs. To ensure the sustainable development of these reserves, the federal government and the cantons must cooperate more closely in spatial planning. Higher utilization rates mean that land that is well developed and only partially built over can be put to better use. In cities and villages with a good quality of life, land consumption and resource use in general are reduced. At the same time, development costs can be reduced. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: More federal competence in spatial planning: Spatial planning must become even more of a collaborative task by setting effective instruments as the standard. No new zoning during the next 20 years, unless building land already zoned in is zoned out again elsewhere. Additional planning values, e.g. due to zoning or better development, are to be skimmed off throughout Switzerland. Inward settlement development and the development of small and medium-sized towns in rural areas are to be promoted: Living, working, shopping and leisure should be brought closer together again thanks to good (infrastructure) planning and with the help of a subsidy and support policy by the federal government and the cantons. Tax incentives for car-free living and for proximity of home and work, tax deductions for commuting costs only for public transport. No more permits for shopping centers and similar facilities outside settlement areas. Safeguarding of crop rotation areas and preservation and enhancement of natural and cultural landscapes. The consideration of a tax on per capita consumption of residential space for the benefit of social housing. Safeguarding the interests of non-profit housing, small businesses and alternative energy-saving forms of housing through spatial planning measures and by promoting an active land policy on the part of the public sector. The framework credit for the ""Fonds de Roulement,"" to promote low-interest loans for social housing, is increased by 200 million Swiss francs. Limiting the percentage of second homes per municipality to 20 percent. The protection of the Alpine region. 2.4 For a sustainable federal fiscal and tax policy The past has shown that the majority of private enterprise acts in its own self-interest and cares little for the common good. The state must therefore increasingly take on community tasks, whether in the area of environmental protection, social security, the development of public infrastructure or education. The funds needed for this are to be raised primarily by reducing unnecessary government tasks (for example, in the army or the highway network), but secondarily also through additional revenues. The entire federal financial system must be subjected to a sustainability audit. All taxes, levies and tax deductions, as well as all subsidies and contributions, must not only be evaluated economically, but also examined for their ecological and social compatibility. In a fair tax policy, individuals and legal entities are taxed according to their economic capacity. Instead of the planned Corporate Tax Reform III, an ecological tax reform is needed. In terms of competitiveness, Switzerland is in a good position, and the federal budget is doing well from a financial point of view. Debt is low, and there is both need and scope for new projects. Further tax reforms with revenue shortfalls are therefore not appropriate for either corporate or individual taxation. On the other hand, public finances must be protected from bailouts for financial institutions and other companies. There must not be a second ""UBS case"". It is also unacceptable that higher requirements for the big banks are cushioned by tax relief, which in turn would have to be paid for by the people in the form of higher value-added tax. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: The abolition of lump-sum taxation. Introduction of a national inheritance tax for the benefit of the AHV. Fiscal federalism must be limited. In the New Division of Finance and Tasks between the Confederation and the cantons, the equalization elements must be strengthened. The ecological tax reform envisaged as part of the federal ""Sustainable Development"" strategy must be implemented. The financial policy of the Confederation, cantons and municipalities must be guided by ecological and social demands. Reviewing all taxes, deductions included, and all levies for sustainability. A consolidation of benefits rather than a reduction in the federal budget. The protection of public finances from bailouts à la UBS. An increase in the CO2 tax and its extension to fuels of all kinds. A revenue-neutral individual taxation independent of civil status. An analysis and regular reporting on the distributional impact of the federal budget in favor of gender-responsive budget policies. 2.5 Corporate responsibility The financial crisis has clearly shown us the extent to which financial markets are globally interconnected. The subprime crisis in the U.S. led to a global financial crisis that swept the economy and caused massive government debt. In other words, high finance has kept its sinecure via state aid . The costs of the financial crisis will be borne by the general public for years to come. It is now imperative to take measures to prevent such financial crises in the future and to address the ""too big to fail"" problem of companies, e.g. with a bank tax, in the sense of an insurance payment for the event of a loss. Industrial corporations with ""too big to fail"" dimensions, such as Novartis or Nestlé, must also be held accountable. Contemporary models of corporate responsibility include state-controlled frameworks for environmental and social standards. Labels introduced voluntarily by companies would make it easier for customers - including the public sector - to choose. Accordingly, a rating would no longer relate solely to creditworthiness, but also to social and environmental aspects. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: Full risk liability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) for all Swiss companies - including banks in particular. To this end, the federal government should issue guidelines for corporate and product liability in the spirit of cost internalization. Switzerland should sign the Kiev Protocol on Liability and Compensation for Transboundary Damage Resulting from Industrial Accidents. Listed companies as well as pension funds and other public investors are required to submit annual sustainability reports in accordance with the recognized standards of the Global Reporting Initiative. The obligation for companies to take responsibility when the health of their employees and/or the public is affected. The right of action against environmental damage, as provided for in the Aarhus Convention, must be introduced. A global transaction tax (Tobin-like tax) in derivatives trading must be introduced globally, or at least Europe-wide, along the lines of the property transfer tax: the longer the security remains with the owner, the lower the tax rate. The serious examination of what impact the separation banking system would have on the big banks with regard to the ""too big to fail"" problem. A revision of the legal basis with regard to banking secrecy: bank customer protection should be anchored in the area of data protection in the same way as attorney or medical secrecy. Ensuring equal pay between women and men in practice and active proof by employers. The establishment of a (state) equal pay commission, which is the contact point for abuses and ensures controls and sanctions with equal pay inspectors. Binding support measures to ensure that all mandates in politics, business and public institutions are distributed in a gender-equitable manner. 3. education, health and social affairs In order for everyone in Switzerland to be able to live with dignity and self-determination and to participate in society, equal opportunities are needed for everyone, regardless of origin, gender, age, religion or lifestyle. Despite many successes in equality policy, women are still disadvantaged in many respects. Foreigners are excluded with increasingly harsh, discriminatory laws, and people with disabilities are constantly threatened with cuts in disability insurance. To ensure equal opportunities for all, strong social insurance and sufficient funding for education and healthcare are needed. 3.1 Education and research The Green Party stands for a holistic, diverse, inclusive school system. The school should not only teach cognitive skills, but also promote social and creative skills, in a framework that promotes respect for human rights. The dual education path with company apprenticeships including vocational baccalaureate and access to universities of applied sciences has proven its worth. This is evidenced by the significantly lower youth unemployment rate in Switzerland compared to other countries. This is precisely why all young people, including Sans-Papiers, should be allowed to complete an apprenticeship so that they can then enter the professional world. Access to education must be independent of socio-economic circumstances. Children with a migration background, from educationally distant backgrounds, or children with an addicted or mentally ill parent often face poor opportunities when they enter school. It is important to improve the living conditions and thus also the future opportunities for these children, for example through early support before the kindergarten level, supplementary childcare services or mentoring. With good schooling, the risk of social inheritance of poverty can be significantly reduced. A wide range of affordable and easily accessible ensures lifelong learning. Real education needs time and freedom. The Greens are critical of the Bologna model. Its implementation must not lead to economization, technocratization and hierarchization of higher education. In addition, there is a need for strong, independent research at universities and universities of applied sciences with priority given to research into sustainable ways of living and doing business, in particular resource-saving technologies and models of society. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: Promoting equal opportunities in education and the labor market. To this end, the Greens are calling for a scholarship system that would, in principle, allow all citizens to receive an education. The school entry with a basic level, an entry age of four to five years and an average duration of four years, as well as flexible transfers to integrative upper schools. Actively seeking ways to address school failure, illiteracy, and illiteracy. More staff resources for the school. A school system without selection before the end of compulsory education. Apprenticeships for all young people, including Sans-Papiers. Incentive measures for companies offering apprenticeships. A right to continuing education for all. In return, everyone should be entitled to at least five paid days per year. An educational policy that aims to strengthen respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Integrating sustainability into all professional and continuing education course programs. Increasing funding for education, research and innovation by ten percent annually, and associated with this, reorienting research priorities toward sustainable development, in particular by strengthening relevant chairs and research programs and priorities at universities. The precautionary principle must be strictly applied to all new technologies. Guidelines for technology impact assessments need to be defined. In particular, legal regulations for nanotechnology analogous to genetic engineering are needed as soon as possible regarding the definition of terms, the scope of application, the question of liability and the declaration obligation. An independent research on the influences of new technologies on health. The complete abandonment of research into non-sustainable technologies, for example nuclear research. 3.2 Migration Because the foreign workforce is necessary for economic development, Switzerland has been an immigration country for decades. While the foreign resident population accounts for only 22 percent, it makes up 28 percent of the working population and thus contributes significantly to the country's prosperity. The people who have had to leave their homeland for political or economic reasons (refugees and Sans-Papiers) make up less than three percent of the total population, often live here under very precarious conditions and are dependent on our help. Only an open migration policy, coupled with an integration policy that strengthens social cohesion among all inhabitants, is a humane policy. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: An integration law that aims at equal opportunities and respect for cultural diversity. The law defines what is allowed and what is not; the rest is a matter of individual freedom. A more liberal federal law on foreigners that makes no distinction between EU and non-EU citizens. In order to regulate the situation of Sans-Papiers, all persons who work in Switzerland under correct and customary conditions must receive a work permit, as well as their families. The marriage ban for Sans-Papiers should be lifted. Simplified naturalization: Second-generation foreigners must be able to naturalize as quickly as possible, while third-generation foreigners receive Swiss citizenship when they reach the age of majority. The naturalization procedure must be standardized at the national level to avoid too many differences between cantons. The waiting period should be reduced from twelve to eight years, as is common practice in most European countries. An efficient and fair asylum policy. If repatriation is not possible, rapid integration is preferable. New grounds for asylum, such as sexual orientation and climate change, must be given greater consideration. Switzerland should consider requests from UNHCR regarding refugee quotas. A uniform and coherent regulation of the funding of intercultural translators, who are to promote understanding between foreign persons as well as health, social and educational professionals. The federal government supports non-profit organizations and associations that deal with migration issues. 3.3 Overcoming the gap between rich and poor The gap between rich and poor is growing. Managers pay themselves fantasy salaries while, according to a Caritas study, up to 900,000 people in Switzerland have to claim help from the welfare state. Social security benefits are becoming increasingly necessary, while the bourgeois majority is pushing for their dismantling. The Greens stand for secure social services and social security for all. An alternative to welfare payments is a general basic income. This social contract, which is fit for the future, massively reduces poverty and existential fears. Economic sovereignty opens up scope for people to help shape society and working life and to perform voluntary and solidarity tasks that are important for a democracy. A strong public service is crucial for the cohesion of society and social balance, as it guarantees that basic services are accessible to all sections of the population, regardless of their financial strength. The Greens are therefore firmly opposed to efforts to cut public services, for example at the post office or the SBB. The Greens do not support outsourcing and privatization of public enterprises. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: Testing a basic income for all. The narrowing of the wage gap: indexed minimum wages of 22 francs per hour, which results in 3800 francs per month (40 hours per week) or 4000 francs per month (42 hours per week), thus reducing the number of workers who have to claim social welfare; a stop to rip-off wages. Enabling people with small and medium salaries to maintain their accustomed lifestyle in retirement thanks to higher contributions from the AHV and 2nd pillar (80 percent of the last salary for salaries up to 5,000 francs, 70 percent for salaries up to 7,000 francs). With regard to the AHV revision, the introduction of a flexible retirement age for all, especially for people with medium and low incomes. In view of the 6th IV revision, no further reduction in IV benefits. A realistic (re-)integration of people with disabilities into the world of work with a binding regulation for companies; no cancellation of pensions for individual diagnostic groups, for example with psychosomatic illnesses; and the introduction of assistance budgets for all people with disabilities. Ensuring an adequate supply of supplementary family childcare that can be financed by all (including start-up financing by the federal government). Family-friendly working time models, including part-time positions, also in management, for women and men. No disadvantage for part-time workers with regard to social security, especially with regard to old-age pensions. Against this background, the abolition of the coordination deduction for pension funds is supported. A general reduction in working hours, six weeks of vacation for all and a redistribution of gainful and inactive work. Supplementary benefits for families affected by poverty. The elimination of the kinship support and repayment requirement in welfare. Data protection also for welfare recipients. The promotion of self-help projects of the unemployed, welfare recipients and those affected by poverty. Supporting cultural, sports and other associations aimed at solidarity and strengthening social relations. 3.4 Health The goal of Green Health Policy is to provide quality care at an affordable price for all. Prevention and health promotion should be at the center of health policy. The premium increases of recent years are unbearable for many and go hand in hand with the economization of the health care system: the lobbying of the health insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry are degenerating the health care system and blocking politics. To break the cost-driving scheme, the Greens are fighting for public health insurance. The Greens also want cross-regional planning among hospitals instead of expensive competition. In the case of medicines, the market for generics must be opened up further. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: Maintaining the quality of medical care and equal access for all to necessary services. Introduction of a public health insurance system based on income and solidarity. Children and adolescents must be exempted from premiums, and refunds to low-income individuals must be harmonized. Further premium increases must be offset by a corresponding increase in reimbursements. Integrated care networks, centralization of equipment-intensive cutting-edge medicine, and supraregional hospital planning. Independent research on the influences of new technologies (electrosmog!) on health. Gender-specific health promotion that takes into account gender differences in prevention as well as in the treatment of diseases. The inclusion of complementary medicine in basic health insurance. Protecting against harmful emissions and promoting a diet of healthy foods. 4. foreign policy and international solidarity According to the top Millennium Development Goal adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2000, the number of people living in extreme poverty is to be halved by 2015. It's a lofty, worthwhile goal. The coming legislature must make the final push for success. Switzerland should therefore henceforth primarily support the poorest people on the planet. At the same time, the supported development must be sustainable and benefit everyone. International institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) or the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have outlived their usefulness or cling to outdated dogmas. They require far-reaching reforms. 4.1 Development cooperation The cultivation of agrofuels and large monocultures is not a sustainable way out of poverty for people in the poorest regions of the world. Switzerland can support efficiency and innovation in local cultivation through the transfer of clean technologies (""cleantech"") and thus help secure food sovereignty. Climate change and its consequences are felt most strongly in the South. Therefore, development cooperation must be guided by the principle of climate justice: In addition to national CO2 reduction, developing countries must be supported in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions with massive financial and technology transfer. Development cooperation should not satisfy the needs of the West and the often corrupt local elite, but actually benefit the poorest population, especially women and children. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: A concentration of development cooperation on the world's poorest. An increase in Swiss development cooperation to 0.7 percent of gross domestic product. That Switzerland advocates binding financial support of 160 billion dollars per year from the industrialized countries for the poorest countries at the climate conference, so that their greenhouse gas emissions are kept within reasonable limits or reduced. For the period from 2013 to 2017, Switzerland will pay 1.7 billion Swiss francs annually into the global climate fund for the same purpose. Defending the food sovereignty and security of the poorest countries against the interests of large farmers and enormous fluctuations in food prices on international markets. Clean drinking water for all as the basis for a healthy life. The free transfer of clean technologies to the world's poorest countries. Paying special attention to the most neglected Millennium Development Goals: addressing child and maternal mortality. This requires gender-sensitive data and the consistent consideration of gender equality in development projects. A stronger commitment by Switzerland to progressive production conditions in low-wage countries. 4.2 Making foreign trade sustainable The multiple crises of recent years have made it abundantly clear that the global economic system is in no way sustainable. They are the result of decades of liberalization, deregulation and privatization policies in the interests of large international corporations. It is time to also subject international trade and goods flows as well as services to new rules of sustainability. In this context, sustainability does not mean the fastest possible return on investment, but rather economic relations that promote the peaceful coexistence of peoples, alleviate need and poverty in the world, and are concerned about preserving the natural foundations of life. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: A Swiss foreign trade that does not unilaterally serve the liberalization of trade, but strives for sustainable development and requires the respect of human rights and democracy of all partner countries. Switzerland must always take this principle into account, both in international institutions and in bilateral agreements. A profound institutional reform of the WTO and the IMF so that they can contribute to solving the multicrisis. In particular, the goals of the Bretton Woods institutions must be geared toward sustainable development. Linking further IMF replenishment loans to conditionality. In line with the Millennium Development Goals, the money is to go primarily and unconditionally to the poorest developing countries (subsidized loans). An active role for Switzerland in combating tax evasion and the introduction of an international insolvency procedure. Switzerland should advocate strict international banking regulation and thus make an important contribution to global economic and social stability. 4.3 Green Europe The EU and its 27 member states are by far Switzerland's most important partners - both because of the EU's political and economic weight and because of their geographical and cultural proximity. In view of this close interdependence, an active European policy is of great importance to the Greens. Today, official Swiss European policy is characterized by stagnation. Switzerland therefore needs a broad and open discussion. The top priorities are the preservation of democracy, the guarantee of fundamental rights and the corresponding welfare state. The bilateral approach, as a policy of tailor-made solutions, is reaching its limits today and will not open up any prospects for Switzerland as a successful and co-determining country in the long term. Static bilateral agreements come into conflict with the further development of EU law The EU's demands for dynamic implementation of the future ""acquis communautaire"" (the automatic updating of EU law at the Swiss legislative level) and Switzerland's resistance to such automatism are not compatible. However, the obligation to adopt laws without a formal say and an exclusively economic cooperation is not an option. Direct democratic achievements such as the HVF, the Alpine Initiative and the moratorium on genetic engineering must be preserved beyond possible EU accession. Rail transport must be given clear priority and the European connections for the NEAT must be ensured. The Greens are calling for the following legislature: No institutional arrangements within the framework of bilateral treaties III, no dynamic follow-up without a say. Public discussion of priority setting in accession negotiations. The start of accession negotiations at an opportune time. Standing up for direct democracy, fundamental rights and the welfare state. No wage and social dumping within the EU. The preservation of Swiss neutrality within the EU - Switzerland should never be affiliated to a European army. Participation in ecological and social restructuring at the European level. No Fortress Europe - a humane migration policy. 5. democracy and pacifism In 2009, $1,500 billion was spent worldwide on armaments, military and war, fifty percent more than in 2000. One twentieth of this sum would be enough to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals and halve world poverty. The ""war on terror"" has led not least to a restriction of the fundamental rights of civil society. 5.1 Peace policy The steep growth in army spending over the past decade is a consequence of the ""war on terror"" - with the opposite effect. It undermines the chances for a just peace in the Middle East. It threatens freedom and civil rights in the West as well. Conventional national defense with compulsory military service is outdated; internal security is the responsibility of the cantons and the police, with the mass proliferation of firearms and the private storage of ordnance weapons among the greatest security risks. Because mass armies can no longer be financed, a reduction in the size of the Swiss army is under discussion. However, neither compulsory military service can be maintained nor the so-called fairness of military service upheld if only a fraction of the 40,000 conscripts required each year are still needed. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: The renunciation of military missions abroad - unless they are within the strict framework of UN-led missions. The termination of cooperation with NATO in the framework of the ""Partnership for Peace"". Resistance to the growing attempts to transform the Border Guard Corps into a federal police force operating throughout the country. Combating the militarization of homeland security. The removal of military weapons from private homes. They belong in secured rooms of the army. Those who want to own, carry and use weapons must prove the need for them and have the necessary skills. The abolition of compulsory military service. The creation of a voluntary civilian service for men and women. A stronger federal commitment to peace and against violence - at home and abroad. An active participation of Switzerland in the international organizations dedicated to the promotion of peace, democracy, respect for different cultures and sustainable development, in particular in the UN and the Council of Europe. 5.2 Fundamental rights and democracy Binding basic democratic rights for all members of society and the preservation of the rule of law are among the fundamental concerns of Green politics. Under the pretext of security, state surveillance and the restriction of central fundamental rights have been intensified for several years. The state is increasingly invading private spaces with coercive measures. With a further tightening of the State Protection Act, telephones, e-mails and communication behavior on the Internet are to be able to be monitored without any suspicion of criminal activity - if necessary with the help of bugs or paid informers. At the same time, the number of new electronic fiches has already reached a record 200,000 in October 2010! State surveillance by video cameras and repressive measures are also constantly increasing in public spaces. Undesirable groups of people are increasingly restricted in their freedom of movement and assembly, such as at sporting events (Hooligan Concordat). Surveillance is also tightened on the train (Railway Police Act) or through checks on persons by the Border Guard Corps at home. While the repressive apparatus and data collections have been massively expanded, the Office of the Federal Data Protection Commissioner is still understaffed. The situation is no better in the cantons. The Confederation also supports the municipalities and cantons in enforcing the increasingly frequent bans on demonstrations: The Federal Intelligence Service (FIS) regularly takes on a coordinating and monitoring role at major events, such as the WEF. The army is increasingly used for civil affairs, such as embassy protection. The Greens are fighting against this militarization of ""internal security."" The Federal Council and the authorities also use a great deal of PR to influence the results of referendums. Against this tendency toward the executive state, the Greens defend parliamentary influence and thus public debate and public control. Switzerland is one of the few democratic countries in which the transparency of party and campaign financing is not regulated. The unequal distribution of financial resources among the political forces means that the different views are not disseminated to the same extent. This is a danger to democracy. Initiatives that violate fundamental rights and/or international law must not be put to the vote in the Green Party's view. They must be declared invalid. The feasibility of an initiative must be examined before it is launched. Switzerland is one of the few countries in Europe that does not have a human rights monitoring body. The Greens are calling for the next legislature: No militarization of ""internal security."" No expansion of civilian and military intelligence services, but the introduction of an actual right to inspect all data collections kept by the intelligence services. Resistance to a repressive policy of expulsion through articles of deportation, rayon bans, and other special laws against certain groups of people. Support and promote measures and projects that foster mutual understanding, tolerance and respect. Data protection through regulations and controls that prevent the aggregation of data that provides an overall view of individuals. No restrictions on the freedom of demonstration and assembly. No transfer of police tasks to third parties: neither to private security services, to military entities nor to the Border Guard Corps. Measures to ensure the free flow of information on the Internet. The authorities' duty of neutrality in elections and votes. Guarantee of uniform dissemination of the various points of view before elections and votes in the public media. A regulation of the financing of parties and campaigns, which ensures transparency. The establishment of an independent, higher supervisory body (court/constitutional court) to verify whether new laws and initiative projects are in conformity with fundamental rights and international law and whether they can be implemented against this background. The establishment of a national institution to monitor compliance with human rights and the prohibition of discrimination in Switzerland, in line with the Paris Principles."

The goal is clear for us Greens: we want to win additional seats in the National Council and Council of States and expand our influence. Because Switzerland needs more green policies. Green policies for the environment, for a sustainable economy and for social and global justice. The Greens are the fifth strongest party in Switzerland and have achieved a great deal in their 30-year history. Our issues have reached the heart of society. What once seemed utopian is now taken for granted: 30 km/h speed limits in residential areas, GMO-free agriculture and openness to diverse lifestyles and family forms. Without the Greens, there would be no energy transition, no maternity insurance, no more flexible retirement age, no modal shift. Without the Greens, Switzerland would be on armed missions in Afghanistan and would have procured 22 superfluous fighter planes. The Greens have shaped and advanced Switzerland as it is today by providing impetus and making political decisions. But we do not want to be satisfied with what we have achieved. Without our persistence, Switzerland will remain stuck halfway in energy or transport policy. Unlike other parties, we also stand by our convictions in the face of headwinds. Like the Greens in the canton of Valais, who were the only party to dare to vote yes to the new spatial planning law.prosperity today is often confused with wealth and unlimited growth. For us Greens, other values count. We want to safeguard scarce resources for future generations. And we are committed to a better quality of life in everyday life, healthy food and our unique landscapes. We also persistently pursue issues that are stuck halfway. With two green popular initiatives, for example, we want to push through the phase-out of nuclear energy and make the economy more environmentally friendly.unfortunately, Switzerland is moving at two speeds. Educational opportunities, wages, wealth and influence are distributed extremely unequally. Today there are ten times more millionaires than in 1980, and wealth is concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. We Greens cannot accept the social divide in society. We demand fair taxes, fair wages and sustainable safety nets so that all people can live in dignity. And we also want to give a voice to those who are not on the sunny side of life.The vote on February 9, 2014 shifted the political axes in Switzerland. A narrow majority of the population opted for the path of uncertainty and isolation. Switzerland's place in the world will be renegotiated in the next legislature. There are three options: Total isolation, globalization of profits or fair cooperation with other states. The Greens are committed to the constructive path of cooperation. We want fair rules for the economy based on human, social and environmental rights. This is the only way we can secure the global basis of life and give people in their countries and regions of origin a perspective.sustainability not only advances the global economy, but also the local economy. Thanks to innovation and intelligent technology, scarce resources can be conserved and waste avoided. Many green people work in their own companies and demonstrate that environmental protection, fair wages and family-friendly forms of work are also economically successful. Such companies create significantly more prosperity than corporations that focus purely on quantitative growth and high profits. Instead of location dumping, we rely on regional economic cycles and the economical use of raw materials and transportation. We do not want to burden our children with even more inherited burdens, and the Greens are the only party today that consistently combines environmental issues with social issues and fundamental liberal rights. One example is our popular initiative for sustainable food. The Fair Food Initiative not only aims to put healthy and organically produced food on the table, but also to strengthen fair working conditions in agriculture. Not only in Switzerland, but also in other countries. In this way, we can change the world with our fork, and a consistent policy can only thrive in independence. We Greens do not allow ourselves to be bought by the lobbies and banks that determine policy in Bern. All the more reason for us to work together with the population, with environmental associations, with creative artists and movements, with trade unions and environmentally conscious companies. We are concerned with the cause. That is why we work together with alliance partners. However, the Greens are also capable of taking initiatives and referendums and are committed to the concerns of the population in numerous communes and cantons in parliaments, governments and commissions. Fifty percent of all cantonal council seats are held by women and, together with the young Greens, we are managing the constant generational change. In line with the motto ""think globally - act globally"", we are also working with the ""Global Greens"" and our European sister parties to promote global climate protection and the energy and resource transition. Together, we are fighting against free trade agreements that seek to sacrifice human rights, animal welfare or public services on the altar of profits. Together, we are committed to tax-friendly financial and commodity markets, a humane asylum policy and global disarmament. If you vote green, you are voting for a network of committed people. If you vote green, you are voting for a Switzerland that has a future.Adele Thorens and Regula Rytz, Co-Presidents of the Swiss Greens What we stand for: Green solutions for today and tomorrow The Greens are the competent and consistent environmental party. But the Greens are also the party of basic liberal rights, equal opportunities and quality of life. The success of our policy is visible in the fact that others like to copy it. We are happy about every support and wish that it will become even stronger. This is the only way we can promote our green economic initiative and the orderly nuclear phase-out next year. In addition to saying yes to our initiatives, we want to move forward in all key policy areas in the next legislature. The Greens are the party of the environment Securing the foundations of life is the central task of Green policy. For the switch to renewable energies by 2050, to curb global warming and for a sustainable spatial planning, settlement and transport policy, the course must be set now. Future generations are also dependent on an intact environment. There is no planet B. The green voice must therefore become even stronger. For a green economy without mountains of waste Natural resources and valuable raw materials are a scarce commodity. Switzerland is more dependent than almost any other country on energy and materials as well as food from other countries. No wonder, 73 percent of Switzerland's environmental pollution is now generated abroad. The Greens are convinced that Switzerland can only maintain jobs and prosperity in the long term with an environmentally compatible economy. Today, far-sighted companies show that it is also possible without waste: Through clever planning and intelligent processes, nature and budget are spared. Our popular initiative ""for a green economy"" prevents waste mountains and stops the overuse of nature. It shows that protecting the environment can become a competitive advantage and secure diverse, decentralized jobs in Switzerland. The Greens are convinced: economic growth based on further exploitation of natural resources is definitely an outdated model. What we want to achieve in the next legislative period: A yes in the referendum on the initiative for a green economy, which demands that Switzerland's ecological footprint be reduced to the size of one planet by 2050. A broad-based and effective revision of the Environmental Protection Act that increases the resource efficiency of Swiss companies and reduces the environmental impact of our consumer products along the global value chains. This includes making greater use of recycling potential, taking into account the environmental impact abroad , and restricting raw materials that are particularly harmful to the environment, such as wood or palm oil from illegal deforestation. An incentive tax on natural resources: We advocated for a comprehensive ecological tax reform that takes into account not only energy, but the entire ecological footprint. Enforcing the polluter pays principle in all areas of resource use and thus avoiding waste and contaminated sites for the next generation. An advanced national disposal fee for packaging, which is passed on to municipalities for the prevention and disposal of waste and for measures against littering. Promoting long-lasting quality products and extending warranty periods to prevent ""organized waste."" Better information for consumers about the sustainability of products (labels for durability, economical use of resources and ease of repair). Greater consideration of environmental and social criteria in the tendering process for public contracts and for financial products and investment instruments Every project, and in particular every construction, infrastructure and IT project, must be reviewed in terms of its necessity and size. For an energy transition that protects the climate and the landscape Around 80 percent of Switzerland's energy needs are met from fossil or nuclear sources. 13 billion Swiss francs flow into the pockets of the global energy multinationals every year.(1) There is another way. In detailed scenarios, the Greens have shown how Switzerland can supply itself with 100 percent renewable energy by 2050. And this without destroying valuable natural landscapes. This is made possible by a mix of subsidy, savings and steering measures. A rapid phase-out of dangerous nuclear energy is crucial. Without further pressure from the Greens and the anti-nuclear movements, the risk is high that nuclear power plants will remain on the grid. Climate protection is also faltering. The Greens want Switzerland to redouble its efforts and take a leading role in international climate policy. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: A Yes to the Green popular initiative to phase out nuclear energy by 2029 at the latest. The enforcement of full risk liability for the operation of nuclear power plants and future storage sites for radioactive waste , as well as a reform of nuclear supervision (four-eye principle, independence and decision-making authority). The tightening of safety requirements for the closure phase and decommissioning of nuclear power plants. The adoption of an energy strategy that combines concrete targets and measures to reduce energy consumption with promotion instruments for renewable energy and an incentive tax on oil, gas, coal, uranium and the other fissile fuels. The goal is 100 percent green energy by 2050. Stricter efficiency standards for buildings, vehicles and appliances. Smart grids for managing distributed power production and frugal consumption. The consideration of non-material concerns such as landscape protection, biodiversity or protection against noise when promoting renewable energies. A consistent climate strategy for Switzerland with the goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 75 percent by 2030 - at least 40 percent of which must be domestic. The increase of the CO2 tax on fuels and the introduction of a CO2 tax on fuels with a full tax rate. Reduction of gray greenhouse gas emissions through declaration, crediting of reduction measures, reduction targets and banning of particularly climate-damaging raw materials (e.g. petroleum products from tar sands, shale gas). Measures to utilize the humus soil to reduce the C02 content in the atmosphere. For less and environmentally friendly traffic Green transport policy is key to quality of life and environmental protection. We want to avoid traffic, shift it to rail and make it compatible with neighborhoods. Despite many successes, we are still a long way from reaching our goal. Today, traffic causes one third of the total environmental impact and a large part of the noise pollution. Its influence on health is also not negligible. Over 30 percent of the gases and energy consumption that are harmful to people and the climate are attributable to motorized mobility. Due to its large growth rates, transport is increasingly reaching the limits of capacity, affordability and acceptance. Instead of expanding infrastructures and sacrificing valuable cultivated land for ever more money, the Greens want to reduce, shift and intelligently direct traffic. To achieve this, capacities must be reduced and the polluter-pays principle strengthened. For example, commuting should not be rewarded by excessive tax deductions. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: A holistic transport policy that makes greater use of the potential of spatial planning, traffic management, work organization and price control. A reform of transport financing through the introduction of ""mobility pricing"". This is intended to promote a switch to environmentally friendly means of transport and to strengthen the polluter-pays principle. A reform of the public transport pricing system: Lower public transport prices at off-peak times and for groups should make it more attractive than private motorized transport. Public transport fares should be socially and family-friendly and lead to better utilization of the infrastructure in off-peak hours through targeted steering measures without compromising quality for passengers. Securing financial resources for regional public transport. Strengthening long-distance international rail services with attractive direct and overnight connections to major cities in Europe to encourage people to switch from air to rail. The continuation of the agglomeration programs within the framework of the new road fund with a focus on public transport, bicycle and pedestrian traffic. This is to be used only for maintenance, but not for the expansion of the road network or for so-called ""bottleneck removal"". Reduction of capacities on national roads. New federal authority for the creation of a national cycling network. The abandonment of the second Gotthard tunnel tube. Instead, the enforcement of the Alpine Initiative, the introduction of an Alpine transit exchange and the securing of routes for freight traffic on the entire rail network. Waiver of the construction of the new Axenstrasse of the N4. Improvement of new car efficiency for combustion engines by 2020: Maximum 85g CO2 emissions per kilometer. Implementation of the ""renewable electromobility"" action plan with the goal of zero emissions by 2050. Reduction of domestic and foreign air traffic and introduction of a fuel tax and a C02 levy on all aircraft movements. For the protection of nature and the preservation of biodiversity One in three animal and plant species in Switzerland is threatened. Through the consumption of imported goods, we also bear responsibility for the protection of nature and biodiversity in other countries. Thanks to a Green Party motion, Switzerland has a biodiversity strategy, but its implementation is still pending. The Greens were also able to strengthen nature conservation and extend the moratorium on genetic engineering in the 2014 2017 agricultural policy. The counter-proposal to our Green Economy Initiative also offers the possibility of reducing imports of products that are particularly harmful to the environment, such as wood from illegal logging (see chapter on the Green Economy). More and more, however, micropollutants are becoming a hazard, especially to humans, and bee mortality continues. Pressure on protected areas, especially wetlands, is not abating, and watercourses are threatened by land overexploitation. With the coexistence regulation, the Federal Council wants to allow genetically modified crops in Switzerland. What we want to achieve in the next legislative period: Implementation of the Biodiversity Action Plan with effective instruments and sufficient financial and human resources. Preservation and expansion of contiguous natural areas, e.g. creation of new nature parks Consistent enforcement of the protection of inventory areas such as moors or dry meadows. Improve the framework conditions for endangered species; wolf and other large predators must remain protected. Implement the action plan against bee mortality. Use natural resources in a way that preserves biodiversity and ecological system services. No new small hydropower plants on still pristine watercourses under the energy strategy. Ensure minimum residual flows and renaturalize watercourses. Better consideration of biodiversity in agricultural policy, especially by combating pesticides, as well as the interconnection of extensively used areas and the protection of areas along watercourses. GMO-free agriculture. Protection and sustainable use of forests. Strict forest legislation must not be weakened in favor of commercial exploitation requests. Funds from federal tourism promotion (Innotour) and regional policy are to be used to promote soft and sustainable tourism in harmony with nature. Regulations to reduce the import of products that harm nature and biodiversity abroad. The Greens are the party of quality of life Prosperity is often confused with growth and wealth. But uncontrolled and unlimited growth reduces the quality of life and increases the waste of vital resources. In addition, more and more people are not only oriented towards material values, but want a better quality of life. This includes neighborhoods based on solidarity, without harmful environmental impacts, as well as healthy food or the freedom to choose an individual way of life. The ""Yes"" to the second-home initiative and to numerous green initiatives for the protection of the cultural landscape show that the population no longer wants to sacrifice its future and nature to one-sided profit interests. Everyone should be able to be happy in their own way, without at the expense of the neighbors, of nature and the next generations. For consistent spatial planning and new perspectives for mountain regions Switzerland is becoming overbuilt: Almost one square meter of cultivated land per second - around ten soccer fields every day - is disappearing under roads, shopping centers, parking lots and houses. Eleven hectares of cultivated land are lost every day. To stop urban sprawl, the Greens are at the forefront of protecting the countryside and cultivated land. The successful cultivated land initiative of the Green Party in the canton of Zurich has become a model for the whole of Switzerland. We want to better protect scarce land and promote compact, family- and generation-friendly settlement development in agglomerations. Sustainable tourism and the strengthening of the regional economy also provide mountain areas with alternatives to urban sprawl and can stop migration. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: The strict implementation of the second home initiative (Lex Weber), but with a correct definition of second homes, by the legislator and the cantons. Consistent enforcement of the revised Spatial Planning Act based on realistic population scenarios. The launch of the second part of the revision of the Spatial Planning Act to enforce strong protection of cultivated land, the preservation of crop rotation areas and the restriction of building outside the construction zones. Whoever concretes new area must offer compensation. Protection against land speculation by means of a tightening of the Lex Koller. A sustainable and targeted development strategy for mountain areas within the framework of the new agricultural and regional policy. As an alternative to the construction of second homes and the organization of unecological major events, the federal government should support structural change in mountain regions through sustainable tourism projects and the marketing of regional products and promote energy-efficient refurbishment of the building stock. In this way, decentralized training and jobs can be secured. The new regional policy 2016+ is to be consistently focused on social and environmental sustainability. The reform of electoral systems (proportional representation) and municipal mergers are intended to increase political participation, the ability to renew and future orientation in the mountain regions should be strengthened. For vibrant neighborhoods and affordable and healthy housing in cities and agglomerations The economical use of land must bring living and working together again and promote inward settlement development. The motto is ""densify and increase"". However, it is only accepted if the quality of life is also good. The Greens, more than any other party, advocated urban green and open spaces and a high level of planning and building culture. Buildings must be designed and constructed in such a way that they do not endanger the health of the occupants. Natural, regionally available building materials are to be preferred. We also want to stop land and housing speculation, because that is the only way to have affordable rents and space for neighborhoods, families and public meeting places. A green transport policy remains crucial for life in cities and agglomerations. The federal government cannot delegate all these tasks to municipalities and cantons, but must take on more responsibility itself. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: A stronger federal commitment to densification and upgrading in urban areas. These include, among other things, minimum regulations for the utilization and occupancy of land, the promotion of modular construction, and the safeguarding of public green spaces in neighborhoods and agglomerations (playgrounds, parks, and open spaces). Housing policies must be designed in such a way that per capita housing requirements do not increase. In the second stage of the RPG revision, planning requirements for the preservation of affordable housing in cities and agglomerations are to be implemented, e.g. Minimum quotas for affordable housing, commercial space or cooperatives, and a right of first refusal for municipalities. The federal government makes land reserves of SBB, armasuisse and other federally-affiliated companies available to non-profit housing developers at favorable rates. The promotion of non-profit housing construction is to be intensified and tenancy law should be strengthened (control of initial rents, obligation to use forms, better protection against dismissal). The framework credit for the ""Fonds de Roulement"" to promote low-interest loans for social housing is increased by 500 million Swiss francs. The federal government, cantons and cities promote flexible, intergenerational forms of housing and ecological neighborhoods. An interdepartmental and interagency Neighborhood Development Agency is to accompany the projects and processes. More federal funding for pedestrian and bicycle traffic in cities and agglomerations and the improvement of traffic safety, especially on routes to school. The federal government supports energy-efficient home renovations on the condition that they are not misused to inflate rents, resulting in the loss of affordable housing. For healthy food and organic farming Mislabeled meat, cheap goods from agricultural factories and toxins in food dominate the headlines. We Greens focus on ecologically and socially responsibly produced food as well as regional products. But the bottom line is that Switzerland cannot feed itself from its own resources. With the Fair Food Initiative, we want to promote the greening of agriculture on both sides of the border and better control the quality of imports. Thus, no more products from animal factories and cage farming are to be imported. Genetic engineering or soy from rainforest deforestation also have no place on fields or in feed troughs. Only with a green agricultural policy can we pass on healthy soils and animals to future generations. Worldwide. What we want to achieve in the next legislative term: Formation of a majority alliance on the Fair Food Initiative. Enforce animal welfare legislation and food quality standards. Market advantage for products from smallholder structures and fair production in food imports. Measures against food waste and the climate impact of food production, storage and transport. Fair trade instead of free trade: Local agricultural markets should be protected from dumping competition and destructive free trade agreements like TTIP, both here and in other countries. Detoxification and relief of soil, water and air through green agriculture. Fair prices and direct payments based on sustainability and biodiversity, and the promotion of sustainable niche products in agriculture. The promotion of climate-friendly food produced and processed in the region, for example through an energy label on food. Continuation of the genetic engineering moratorium. Combating the dependence of farmers worldwide on agricultural corporations through patented genetically modified seeds. No patents on animals and plants and no speculation with food. For strong public education and the cross-border strengthening of innovation, research and culture Switzerland is poor in raw materials but rich in innovative spirit and creativity. These thrive only in a climate of openness and tolerance and live from the cross-border exchange of ideas and people. We Greens want to defend the international partnerships of universities, universities of applied sciences, research and culture against the right-wing nationalist foreclosure policy and the austerity apologists. But we also oppose the tendency to privatize knowledge and focus on short-term economic benefit. An innovation-promoting climate thrives on interdisciplinary exchange, cultural diversity and openness. This also includes multilingualism in Switzerland. By improving the work-life balance and promoting equal opportunities, people with a wide range of experiences and life situations should help develop solutions to the challenges of the future. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: Continuation of Switzerland's participation in European research and cultural programs such as film funding. Continuation of the exchange program me for schoolgirls and students. In the 2017-2020 ERI Dispatch on Education, Research and Innovation, in addition to strengthening and recognizing higher vocational education and training, the areas of sustainability, gender equality, gender studies, interdisciplinarity and the promotion of young scientists are to be strengthened. The Federal Council should also make good on its promise to create more training places in human medicine. Transparent and clear regulations for sponsorship contracts and for additional income of senior university employees at all universities. A good balance between basic and applied research and the promotion of start-ups, especially in the cleantech and climate sectors. The expansion and harmonization of the scholarship system to ensure a minimum standard of living for students. The enforcement of training, continuing education and study programs as well as higher vocational education at universities, universities of applied sciences and in higher vocational education. Ensure an open and fair welcome for foreign students, who make an important contribution to the quality of education. Securing financial resources for the 2016-2019 Cultural Message. Cultural exchange and cultural participation should be more strongly promoted Sufficient funds for the implementation of the Youth and Music Initiative. The Federal Council withdraws from the negotiations on the international agreement on the privatization of the public service (TISA). Advocacy at the international level for a fundamental revision of patent and plant variety protection laws by combating the commercialization of knowledge and of life. An open-access system of science publications (Open Science). 3The Greens are the party of fundamental rights and socially and politically liberal values In questions of democracy, human rights and the separation of powers, Switzerland was ahead of many countries in 1848. Today, the liberal values of yesteryear are under pressure. Basic principles of the rule of law are being thrown overboard. Surveillance and exclusion displace policies of integration and dialogue. The Greens are committed to a political culture that puts fundamental rights and freedoms back at the center. We want a transparent state, not transparent citizens. And we are convinced that a pluralistic society can only function with mutual respect and openness. For a democracy without racism, discrimination and exclusion Freedom is always the freedom of those who think differently. This cornerstone of democracy is increasingly being called into question. The Greens are at the forefront of advocating respect for human rights and the protection of minorities. No one should be discriminated against and excluded on the basis of origin, age, religion, gender, lifestyle, sexual orientation, gender identity or language. The Greens are convinced that mutual respect is the guiding principle for living together. We want a society in which everyone has their place and can help shape life together. The role of the European Convention on Human Rights must not be weakened because the Swiss Constitution does not provide a guarantee against the violation of fundamental rights in laws. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: The defense of the rule of law and the principle of proportionalityais core elements of a modern democracy. The defense of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the protection of fundamental rights in Switzerland. Promoting non-violent methods of managing conflict, for example, mediation. Promoting out-of-court mediation and victim-offender mediation. A campaign against racist content in social media and political party communications, and the strengthening of the Federal Commission against Racism. Anchoring the protection against discrimination in an anti-discrimination law. The punishment of incitement to hatred against any group of the population. No way of living together should be disadvantaged compared to another, especially in tax and social security law. The full opening of marriage to same-sex couples and their admission to the adoption process. A consistent implementation of the Disability Equality Act. Information and services provided by the public sector (federal government, cantons, municipalities) and government-related businesses must be accessible without barriers. Accessibility must also be promoted in the private sector and in the media with suitable instruments. The support of the initiative for reparation for victims of compulsory social measures. Spatial planning measures to secure the sites for the Travellers. Popular initiatives must respect the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). For the equality of women and men and more gender justice Equality between men and women is far from being achieved. Women are underrepresented in many professions and in management positions and are discriminated against in wages. For their part, men can hardly take on any more responsibility for the household and raising children. So this falls mainly to women. This leads to small part-time jobs, low wages and poor cards for securing one's livelihood in old age. The Greens call for better protection of care work and the enforcement of pay equity. Men also want to change their traditional roles. They want more part-time jobs, more responsibility in childcare and finally parental leave for fathers as well. Thanks to green commitment, some cities and cantons have made steps forward. Now we have to step up the pressure on the federal government. The Greens are committed to ensuring that every person is free to choose their gender and does not have to choose to live as a woman or a man. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: The enforcement of wage equality between women and men through binding wage analyses and controls as well as sanctions against wage discrimination. The introduction of paternity leave and parental leave (financed through the income replacement scheme). The better compatibility of family and career. This includes the continuation of start-up funding for supplementary family childcare, but also more family-friendly training and work models (fairly regulated, flexible working hours, working from home, teleworking) and the promotion of day schools. Greater involvement of employers and the public sector in the financing of supplementary family childcare, such as the models developed in the cantons of Vaud, Neuchâtel and Fribourg. This is the only way to prevent middle-class family budgets from sinking due to high care rates and taxes despite second incomes. High-quality and affordable childcare that complements family life is a right for everyone and contributes to equal opportunities for men and women. The end of gender stereotypes in family, education, training and work and the strengthening of freedom of choice. Political measures and information measures to counteract a stereotyped image of women and men, which is passed on in particular through advertising and the media. The stronger protection of care work in the social security systems. The promotion of part-time positions for men and at all hierarchical levels and in all areas, especially in the federal administration. Reduction of working hours so that care work and voluntary commitments can be taken on. Quotas for a balanced representation of women and men in management functions, in particular in the federal administration, the federally-affiliated companies, the boards of directors and on the election lists of the political parties. The continuation and increase of the campaign against domestic violence, greater support for women's shelters and the expansion of child protection and assistance for female and male victims, also strengthening the fight against human trafficking. An independent residence permit or at least a guarantee of renewal of residence permits for migrant women in cases of spousal violence. A broad campaign against sexual violence and strengthening the protection of women and men in legislation. For consistent data protection and digital rights Progressive digitization is having an impact on all areas of society. Network policy is therefore a cross-cutting task for the Greens. The Greens want to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the information society, but also recognize the risks at an early stage. In the view of the Greens, the Internet is not just a technical tool, but a place of exchange that can and should also be used for more democratic co-determination and for a more sustainable society. The Greens see the greatest need for action in network access, data protection, the enormous consumption of energy and resources by the technical infrastructure, and fair compensation for copyrights. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: Better protection of privacy and fundamental digital rights: A new data protection law must enshrine fundamental digital rights and set limits on the sharing and linking of data (Big Data). A powerful open network for all: enshrining net neutrality in law and affordable access to high-bandwidth Internet. Strategy for Bridging the Global Digital Divide through Development Cooperation. Interference with fundamental rights such as freedom of expression or freedom of information may only occur on a legal basis and by judicial decision. These interventions must be necessary and proportionate. We reject the surreptitious spying on computers and the use of state Trojans without justified suspicion or for retention. ""Cybersecurity"" must not be a cloak for a snooping state: therefore, the retention of data without any reason must be stopped. The federal government should increasingly use open source solutions and fairly manufactured, environmentally friendly hardware. Alternative remuneration models are to be developed for the unlawful private use of copyrighted works (e.g., when uploading to file-sharing networks). For transparent democracy and comprehensive co-determination rights The strong co-determination of the population and federalism are central pillars of Swiss democracy for the Greens. But we also see a need for reform. Many parties today have themselves financed by companies such as UBS or Credit Suisse. Often, corporate lobbyists sit in parliament in person and represent their own interests instead of the common good. The Green Party was the first to establish ethical guidelines for party donations and transparency of funds. Such rules of the game are also needed at the national level. In addition, equal opportunities and the protection of minorities in the electoral system must finally be enforced. The foundations of democracy also include media diversity and the political education and participation of young people. After numerous procurement and corruption scandals in the federal administration, the Greens also see a need for action in corporate governance. Government services must be efficient, transparent and accountable to society. Establish transparency guidelines for election and political campaign financing. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: The introduction of a party financing system that gives all parties a level playing field in terms of basic services and reduces dependence on private lobbies. Binding federal regulations for the protection of political minorities in small cantons with a majoritarian electoral system. On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the National Council proportional representation in 2019, the principles of equality and minority protection enshrined in the Federal Constitution must finally be implemented nationwide. It must apply: Every vote of every voter has the same weight, regardless of the canton. The introduction of voting age 16 and a campaign to promote media education and media literacy among youth and young adults. The political voice and participation of people with a foreign passport (e.g. voting rights at the municipal and cantonal level for foreigners who have lived in Switzerland for five years). The targeted promotion of independent journalistic media services as well as media diversity and media quality. The Greens demand the timely, full and rapid disclosure of official documents in accordance with the principle of transparency. Binding criteria and a financial cap for external consultant contracts in the federal administration. A strategy focused on sustainability rather than luxury for federal buildings, which should be functional, cost-effective, and resource-efficient. The approval and use of credits for public buildings shall again be controlled by special parliamentary commissions. A financial policy that secures central services for citizens in the long term and can support social balance in times of crisis. 4 The Greens are the party of equal opportunity and social justice Equality of opportunity is a foundation of democracy. It is increasingly challenged by growing inequalities in wages, wealth or education. While the upper income and wealth classes make pilgrimages from tax haven to tax haven, more and more people are asking themselves: How can I afford the apartment rent or the next health insurance bill? The Greens have the answers: with a fair and family-friendly tax system. With equal pay for women and men. With solid education and training, including the acquisition of basic skills, and a strong social partnership. We Greens also defend the social safety net so that people with disabilities, in old age, unemployment, illness and economic hardship do not fall through the cracks. For social security in all situations and a modern family policy No party has shaped the opening of society in Switzerland as much as the Greens. Whether people live together in shared apartments, go through life as patchwork families or as a same-sex couple is no longer worth talking about. The coexistence of generations has also become more diverse. Now, social support and safety nets must also be adapted to the new ways of life. Green social policy is not only focused on the traditional family, but takes into account the diversity of life situations. It focuses on prevention and early detection in the health and social sectors and is guided by a central constitutional principle: ""The strength of the people is measured by the welfare of the weak."" Already today, social welfare benefits are at the edge of the subsistence level. The further cutbacks demanded by the right-wing bourgeoisie would drastically exacerbate the precarious situation of those affected by poverty. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: A reform of family policy that enables parents and children to lead economically secure lives regardless of family model, income or background. These include adjustments to family law, taking care work into account in alimony and pension arrangements, and replacing tax deductions with a more socially just allowance system. The ""Pension 2020"" project must be guided by the goal of living a dignified life in old age. Today's pension benefits must not be reduced. The Greens support the popular initiative ""AHV plus"" and reject the planned increase of the women's pension age to 65 years if equal pay and the protection of care work continue to be delayed. A retirement ""a la carte"" that takes better account of retirement age and the health burden of working life. Partial retirement models are intended to facilitate a gradual transition to retirement. Strengthening health promotion and addiction prevention. Combat the illicit drug trade by decriminalizing consumption and regulating trafficking. Enable pilot projects at the cantonal and especially municipal level to regulate cannabis use. A refinement of risk equalization among health insurers. The Confederation should also create the legal possibility to introduce regional and cantonal single health insurance funds and to promote cooperation among health care providers (managed care). A national framework law for social assistance based on the undiminished inflation-adjusted benefits of the SKOS guidelines. Introduction of supplementary benefits for families. Recognition of complementary medicine as a full FMH discipline, as well as opportunities for personal development so that the public can make their own decisions in the area of health care. For broad access to education and training For the Greens, school is an important society-building institution. Mediated by teachers, it does its part to ensure that the interests of individuals serve the community as a whole. To this end, it fulfills the statutory educational mandate and ensures the participation of all in a democratic society. The school system thus makes education possible for everyone, be it with a Federal Vocational Certificate or a Certificate of Proficiency, be it with a high school diploma, a technical diploma or a vocational diploma. It places equal emphasis on all training courses to promote intellectual, social, artistic and manual skills. This will only succeed if sufficient resources are made available, especially for those who do not get on with initial training and need to reorient themselves, and if working conditions in apprenticeships are improved. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: Easier access to learning to read and write in order to develop the necessary skills so that everyone can meet the demands of today's society. To promote equal opportunities in education and training through the expansion and harmonization of the scholarship system and its development in order to provide students with the minimum standard of living. Promoting the Erasmus program to ensure a broader educational experience for students from Switzerland. The promotion of language competence and the overcoming of the Röstigraben: The first foreign language must be a national language. The school systems in the small educational area of Switzerland, where people are becoming increasingly mobile, must be further harmonized. At the same time, innovative, inclusive, and diverse school models must be encouraged - through appropriate curricula and sufficient funding. Sufficient funds for education and training at all levels of the federal education system. Apprenticeships should become more attractive again thanks to fair wages and better working conditions. Strengthening dual vocational training. The willingness of companies to train should be promoted and recognized, e.g. with a bonus-malus system for training in the healthcare sector or in public tenders. Here, preference is to be given to domestic and foreign companies that are also involved in training. A second chance for young people and adults without vocational qualifications. Vocational schools should remain free of charge even if apprenticeships are started late, and companies should be encouraged through incentives to provide post-qualification training. Sans-papiers children and children of asylum seekers should continue to be able to attend school or do vocational training. For fair working conditions and wages The unacceptable location and tax dumping is causing more and more companies to move from neighboring countries to Switzerland. At the same time, many companies benefit from recruiting low-paid skilled workers abroad to increase their profits. The Greens are calling for long-overdue reforms to counter this negative spiral. Reforms in the labor market, reforms in the tax system. Green women entrepreneurs are showing how progressive working time models, fair wages and targeted training and further education can ""find and retain"" skilled workers. Older employees and IV recipients should also have a chance again. The fruits of labor must be distributed more fairly and not just flow into the pockets of managers and shareholders. To achieve this, minimum wages and reductions in working hours are needed. Part-time work must be able to become the standard for all. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: Strengthening the social partnership by lowering the hurdles for declaring collective labor agreements generally binding. Business should make good on its promise to raise low wages and stop self-enrichment in the executive suites. The expansion and consistent enforcement of accompanying measures to protect wages and working conditions. Measures to address the shortage of skilled workers in healthcare and STEM (mathematics, information technology, natural sciences and technology) professions and to improve pay and working conditions in nursing. Measures against location and tax dumping. Economic development should be focused on strengthening decentralized and sustainable development. The Corporate Tax Reform III is to be used to slow down harmful tax competition in the cantons. However, it must not result in any loss of tax revenue. Rather, harmful effects of the CTR II are to be corrected. A restriction of fiscal federalism through national minimum rates for corporate taxes and better control of tax rulings and tax rebates within the framework of cantonal economic development. The introduction of a capital gains tax and the plugging of tax loopholes. A reform of national and international procurement law, which includes social and ecological quality criteria. For a strong public service and a fair tax policy When it comes to essential goods such as water, energy, education, health or public infrastructure, there is a need for government services that are accessible to all. The Greens advocated a solid basic supply also in mountainous and peripheral regions. And we demand that high-income earners, wealth millionaires and the business community contribute appropriately to the financing of public services. This requires reforms in the tax system. The tax system must become fairer and take greater account of economic performance. In addition, the equalization instruments between the cantons are to be further developed. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: Important public goods such as water, energy supply and technical infrastructure remain in public hands and are managed sustainably. The Greens oppose further liberalization steps in the electricity market. Primary care must be guaranteed in all cantons and regions of Switzerland. The Confederation is developing an infrastructure concept that builds on a national spatial concept and ensures the long-term and user-pays financing of public infrastructures. Greater harmonization of the tax system in Switzerland with the aim of eliminating the objectionable unequal treatment of female citizens in the various cantons and giving greater weight to economic performance. Examine a system of individual taxation that is revenue-neutral and independent of civil status. The introduction of a national inheritance tax for the benefit of the AHV. Ensuring the exchange of data between tax authorities at home and abroad. In order to ensure the controls, the tax authorities need sufficient resources and personnel. In doing so, the principles of data protection must be respected. Developing countries must also be able to access tax data. The further development of the national financial equalization system. 5 The Greens are the party of openness and responsibility without borders The globalization of the economy is changing the role of democratic states. Free trade agreements, such as TTIP(2), remove the ability of citizens to shape their own lives and place them in the hands of large international corporations. The Greens do not oppose the ""trilemma of globalization"" with dreams of isolation, but want globalization to be ecological, social and democratic channels. Our long-standing motto ""Think globally - act locally"" is still relevant. Increasingly, however, global action is also required within the framework of international rules and organizations. The Greens are only in favor of international treaties that have a positive impact on the environment, society or the economy, both in Switzerland and abroad. For a good neighborhood with Europe and the world The adoption of the mass immigration initiative was a paradigm shift for Switzerland. A slim majority of the population has reacted to domestic problems with compartmentalization. Political isolation will lead the internationally networked Switzerland into a dead end. The Greens are committed to good relations with our neighboring countries and fairer rules for global markets. Switzerland should be a reliable partner in the international community and make a committed contribution to the promotion of democracy, prosperity, peace, security and the preservation of the ecological foundations of life on our planet. As the depositary state of the Refugee Convention and the Conventions on International Humanitarian Law, it should also be a model for others. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: An implementation of the mass immigration initiative that is compatible with the bilateral treaties and a safeguarding of bilateral cooperation with the EU. If this is not possible by parliamentary means, then a fundamental vote on the continuation of the bilateral agreements must be held. A solution for institutional cooperation with the EU. A stronger commitment of Switzerland in international organizations. Respect for applicable international agreements, in particular the 1951 Refugee Convention. A strengthening of Swiss development cooperation and its effectiveness, as well as an expansion of aid in the field. Switzerland's contribution to the international climate fund should not be financed from the development budget, but through a CO2 levy on fuels in line with the polluter-pays principle. Binding rules for the global financial markets to prevent bankruptcies, crashes and government bailouts. Capital adequacy rules need to be further tightened and trading in financial products and commodities better monitored and controlled. Switzerland should not only comply with international law, but also play an active role in the fight against global tax havens and financial market risks. A central step is the introduction of a global financial transaction tax. (2) Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement) Political and economic cooperation with unjust states (such as the former apartheid regime in South Africa) must be historically reviewed and politically assessed. This requires access to the archives and official statements by the Federal Council on the involvement of Swiss authorities and companies in crimes against humanity. Reducing obstacles to mobility for the 450,000 Swiss citizens living in EU countries through recognition of academic and professional qualifications, contributions to the education of young Swiss abroad, education and training opportunities abroad, and participation in programs to promote mobility. For peace policy and disarmament No other party has rejected the procurement of new fighter aircraft as clearly as the Greens. The success of the Gripen referendum is an important prelude to further army reforms. For the Greens, it is clear that the army must be greatly reduced and must not take on any civilian tasks. The response to the increase in global conflicts should not be rearmament, but an expansion of civil peacebuilding and a strict ban on arms exports. Because only the UN can form a basis for world peace, we call for its strengthening against special alliances such as NATO, which represent not universal but special interests. Banning guns from the private sphere is also intended to improve domestic security. Non-violent conflict resolution must be promoted. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: Reduction of the army and the military budget. Preventing the evaluation and purchase of a new fighter jet. Renunciation of internal and civilian missions of the armed forces and of military missions abroad. Creation of a professional disaster relief corps. For a civilian service that is equal to military service and also open to women Prohibition of any export of weapons. Stop all arms and military cooperation with all countries that violate human rights and disregard international law. Withdrawal from the NATO Partnership for Peace and increased involvement in the UN and OSCE. Commitment to a just peace between Israel and Palestine and to the creation of a Palestinian state. Banishment of ordnance weapons to armories and registration of all weapons. For fair trade and rights without borders Hardly any other country is as dependent on foreign raw materials and foodstuffs as Switzerland. At the same time, the small state in the Alps operates as the largest offshore financial center and second-largest commodity trading center in the world. Most commodity countries suffer from the ""commodity curse"" and have their development blocked by corruption, repression, ecological destruction and human rights violations. Profits from the commodities business flow into Switzerland; in the two commodities trading centers of Zug and Geneva alone, they increased fourteenfold between 2001 and 2011. The Greens demand that multinationals based in Switzerland assume their responsibility for sustainable global development in accordance with their size and do not continue to line their own pockets. Just like on the soccer field, clear spar rules are needed and a referee who draws the red card when a foul is committed. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: Greater transparency, in particular the disclosure of country- and project-specific payments, including for commodity trading, as well as comprehensive disclosure of ownership in the cantonal commercial registers. A supervisory authority for trading in commodities and foodstuffs (Rohma), analogous to the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma). Binding corporate liability and due diligence to uphold human, environmental and labor rights in mines and on plantations, including a sanctions regime and redress rules. The traceability of raw materials, products and services along the entire production and supply chain. The prohibition of speculation with food as well as land grabbing. The extension of existing international agreements, such as the Basel Convention on the Disposal and Transport of Waste, to the production and trade of raw materials. A global transaction tax (Tobin-like tax) in derivatives trading must be introduced globally, or at least Europe-wide, along the lines of the property transfer tax: the longer the security remains with the owner, the lower the tax rate. For a humane migration and asylum policy Not since World War II have so many people had to seek refuge from persecution, war and natural disasters in another part of their country or abroad. At the same time, Switzerland has continuously tightened its asylum policy and reception conditions for migrants from countries outside the European Union. For the Greens, the freedom to settle anywhere in the world must be a human right. They oppose the restrictive, discriminatory and sometimes inhumane policies towards asylum seekers and advocate for an open Switzerland that respects the rights of migrants. The poverty that forces many people to emigrate is not simply a given: it is the result of corruption, commodity speculation and capital flight - and Switzerland contributes to it with the banks and multinationals in our country. It must therefore do all the more to promote international solidarity, step up aid on the ground, and more generously welcome those fleeing misery or seeking protection. The Greens also take the Federal Council to task here. The promised admission of refugee contingents and the introduction of a humanitarian visa in its current form is no substitute for the abolished embassy asylum. What we want to achieve in the next legislature: Integration is a cross-cutting task that must be anchored in regular structures and aims to promote non-discriminatory access to public services for all people, refugees, migrants and residents. Automatic naturalization of the second and third generation. Compliance with the principles of proportionality and non-refoulement in the implementation of the deportation initiative. Preventing any further tightening of asylum laws. The further development of the Dublin Agreement in the sense that the reception and accommodation of refugees is understood as a common task of all member states. Switzerland should exhaust all possibilities in the Dublin Agreement to prevent people in need of protection from being returned to countries that do not guarantee them a proper takeover. A uniform and coherent regulation of the funding of intercultural translators, who are to promote understanding between foreign persons as well as health, social and educational professionals. Basic rights also apply to Sans-Papiers. All those who work without legal status must be regularized by category or collectively after four years of residence. A fair and efficient asylum policy, committed to fundamental rights, which guarantees a dignified reception, speedy procedures and independent legal assistance. Those who have refugee status and cannot be repatriated should receive a residence permit, especially if they are well integrated and financially independent. Grounds for asylum such as conscientious objection, sexual orientation, and climate change must be given greater consideration - especially women-specific grounds for asylum. Switzerland should respond positively to requests from the UNHCR regarding refugee quotas. The reintroduction of the embassy procedure in the asylum system. The state can refer rejected asylum seekers to NGOs, for cooperation and to make their return meaningful. Switzerland must present an action plan for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, especially in the area of asylum. Unrestricted family reunification must be guaranteed. Switzerland must guarantee women an independent residence independent of their husbands, especially in cases of domestic violence. Non-EU citizens must not be discriminated against in the labor market. Switzerland is committed to ensuring that the Frontex agency respects human rights. In addition, it is to support maritime states in the rescue and reception of boat refugees"
43110,201910,"ELECTION PLATFORM 2019-2023 INTRODUCTION Switzerland needs more green policies. Green policy for the environment, for the climate, for a sustainable economy and for social justice in Switzerland and in the world. The national elections on October 20, 2019, will be a pivotal juncture in this regard. We Greens therefore want to gain at least four seats in the National Council and the Council of States and expand our influence. The GREENS are the fifth strongest party in Switzerland and have achieved a lot in their 36-year history. Our topics have reached the heart of society. The GREENS have made the nuclear phase-out and the energy turnaround capable of gaining majority support. The first nuclear reactor in Mühleberg, Bern, will be shut down in 2019. GMO-free agriculture or the reconciliation of work and family life are green achievements, as are registered partnerships, modal shift and 30 km/h speed limits in residential areas. Without GREENS, Switzerland would be on armed missions in Afghanistan and would have procured 22 superfluous fighter planes. We GREENS have been the driving force behind Switzerland as it is today. But we cannot be satisfied with what we have achieved. The world we live in is changing rapidly. This applies to the world of work, where globalization, flexibilization and digitalization are creating new uncertainties. This applies to politics and society, where unrestrained populism, de-solidarization, attacks on democracy and human rights are rampant. And this is especially true for climate change, which is accelerating, and for biodiversity, which is being visibly and irreversibly lost. Today, prosperity is often confused with wealth and unlimited growth. For us GREENS, other values count. We want to safeguard scarce resources for future generations by living more frugally. And we are committed to improving the quality of everyday life, healthy food and our unique landscapes. The traditional popular parties are in crisis worldwide and are being overrun by populist movements. These increasingly call into question the values and rules of the game of modern, liberal democracy and the separation of powers. Their anti-liberal policies are fed by growing inequality. Switzerland has also been moving at two speeds since the slide to the right in October 2015. Educational opportunities, wages, wealth and influence are highly unequally distributed. We GREENS cannot accept the social divide in society. We demand fair taxes, fair wages and sustainable safety nets so that all people can live in dignity. The GREENS have become the beacon of hope for a future worth living for people all over Europe. They stand for the protection of the natural foundations of life as well as for social cohesion, Openness, Peace and social justice. This force must also be strengthened in the 2019 national elections, as a bulwark against right-wing populism, against climate skeptics and against the imposition of the right of the strong and the unscrupulous worldwide. The GREENS are the only party today that consistently combines environmental issues with social issues and basic liberal rights. We live by the motto ""deeds not words"". The equality of women and men, The enforcement of the rights of all people, regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity (LGBTIQ*). as well as cooperation with people from a wide range of countries are a matter of course for us. We GREENS will not be bought by the insurance companies, banks and other powerful lobbyists who determine policy in Bern. All the more reason for us to work together with the population, with civil society organizations, with environmental associations, with cultural workers and movements, with trade unions and environmentally conscious companies. The ability to form alliances is one of our great strengths. However, the GREENS are also capable of taking the initiative and of initiating referendums, and they advocate the concerns of the population in numerous municipalities and cantons in parliaments, governments and commissions. And if these institutional means are not enough, the GREENS are also on the streets, at the women's strike, at rallies against racism, against nuclear power plants and against social cuts, for climate protection, refugees and human rights. We Greens are part of a global movement: Together with the Global Greens and our European sister parties, we are also driving forward global climate protection, the energy transition and a social and solidarity-based circular economy. Together we fight against free trade agreements that want to sacrifice human rights, animal welfare or public services on the altar of profits. Together, we advocate for tax-efficient financial and commodity markets, a humane asylum policy and for worldwide disarmament. When you vote green, you vote for a network of committed people. Those who vote green are voting for a Switzerland that has a future. Regula Rytz, Balthasar Glättli, Lisa Mazzone, Regula Tschanz WHAT WE STAND FOR The GREENS are the competent and consistent environmental party. But the GREENS are also the party of basic liberal rights, social responsibility and quality of life. Experience shows: The stronger the GREENS are in parliament, the greener the other parties appear. If you vote green, you have an impact. This election platform shows where we will focus our efforts in the 2019-2023 Legislature. We are aware that our demands are ambitious and consistent. As a party with head, heart and backbone, we lead the way. We are looking for majority solutions that move us forward. 1. THE GREENS ARE THE PARTY OF THE ENVIRONMENT Safeguarding the foundations of life is the central task of green policy. Already today, these are threatened by climate change, loss of biodiversity, inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus into the biosphere, and land use. We must set the course now for the green energy turnaround and for a future-compatible economic, settlement and transport policy. There is no one-size-fits-all miracle cure for this. It is a combination of measures and solutions that will take us forward. Personal commitment, political guard rails and responsible entrepreneurs are necessary to secure a future worth living for future generations. If we act quickly and boldly now, the necessary changes will become a social and economic opportunity. 1.1 FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT We are the first generation to feel the consequences of the climate crisis. And the last one that can still change something. Glacier melt, droughts, and the increase in temperature and weather extremes prove that there is not much time left to implement the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. According to science, climate heating must be limited to 1.5 degrees in order to contain the risk of uncontrollable, irreversible and dangerous developments. Switzerland is particularly affected by climate change. However, it is also strongly responsible for the financial center and the multinational corporations based here. It must participate in internationally coordinated measures and itself lead the way with a pioneering spirit. No country has better conditions than we do. Innovative universities and cleantech companies are driving change. By phasing out oil, gas and coal, we are not only alleviating the climate crisis, but also our dependence on energy imports. Jobs and value creation remain here. In the next legislature, we want to achieve that: the Glacier Initiative, co-sponsored by the GREENS, is adopted, which aims to reduce fossil CO2 emissions to zero by 2050 in order to implement the commitments of the Paris Climate Agreement in a binding manner. Switzerland should also align itself with the ambitious goal of the Climate Strike movement to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in Switzerland by 2030. legal channels are strengthened and created to combat climate change and oblige the federal government to protect the population. a CO2 Act is passed with the aim of reducing domestic CO2 emissions by at least 60 percent by 2030. a binding phase-out plan for fossil fuel technology is defined: no new fossil fuel heating systems and no new road capacity with immediate effect, from 2025 onwards no new fossil-fueled passenger cars and no new fossil-fueled industrial plants from 2030. CO2 emissions from existing industrial plants must be fully compensated. the financial center protects the climate and gradually withdraws from investments in fossil energies by 2030. the CO2 tax on fuels is increased to safeguard and expand the building renovation program. measures to adapt to climate change are financed according to the polluter-pays principle and that a climate levy on gasoline, diesel and kerosene (climate 10 rappers) is introduced for this purpose. the green action plan for renewable electromobility with the goal of ""zero emissions by 2050"" is implemented. domestic and foreign air traffic is reduced, especially on routes with adequate train connections, night flight closures are extended, an air ticket levy to promote sustainable tourism and a CO2 levy on kerosene are introduced. the gray greenhouse gas emissions of imported products generated abroad are reduced. This is to be achieved by means of a CO2 levy on imported emissions, optimized production processes, measures against deforestation, an ecological public procurement system and electricity imports from renewable energies. CO2 emissions caused by agriculture and food are reduced. This is to be done in particular by reducing food waste, but also by stopping subsidies to promote meat consumption. the indigenous and renewable resource wood is used more intensively through constructive timber construction and also in terms of energy. 1.2 FOR THE ACCELERATION OF THE GREEN ENERGY TRANSITION Around 80 percent of Switzerland's energy requirements are met from fossil or nuclear sources. 13 billion Swiss francs flow into the pockets of global energy multinationals every year. With the nuclear phase-out initiative (46 percent yes votes), the GREENS paved the way for the Energy Strategy 2050. But implementation is stalling. In the case of nuclear energy, the Federal Council has even shifted into reverse gear. By restarting the world's oldest nuclear power plant, Beznau 1, and weakening safety regulations, he is breaking his promise to phase out nuclear power. And puts obstacles in the way of all ventures that want to create local jobs and prosperity with the green energy transition. That has to change. In the next legislative period, we want to ensure that: the first stage of the Energy Strategy 2050 is implemented quickly. The current blockade on photovoltaics must be lifted and the waiting list reduced. An annual addition of 800 MW/year must be achieved. a second stage of the Energy Strategy 2050 is being developed. With the goal of supplying Switzerland with 100 percent renewable energy by 2050 at the latest, thanks to a rapid phase-out of nuclear power and the complete decarbonization of the energy sector. A solution must also be found that is compatible with the population in terms of nuclear waste repositories. increased safety requirements for the final phase and decommissioning of nuclear power plants must be enforced. The independence of nuclear supervision must finally be enforced through the inclusion of international experts and the appointment of independent, critical personalities to the top positions of the Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate ENSI and the Commission for Nuclear Safety NSC. a binding phase-out plan from nuclear energy ensures more investment security for the production of electricity from renewable sources. The Beznau 1 and 2 nuclear power plants must be shut down immediately and permanently due to unacceptable safety risks. the polluters (energy companies and consumers) contribute appropriately to the decommissioning and disposal of nuclear power plants as quickly as possible. full risk liability is enforced for nuclear power plants during and after their operating life as well as for interim and final storage sites. intelligent electricity grids control decentralized electricity production and promote economical consumption. Data protection and equal treatment of customers are of great importance. Environmental concerns such as landscape protection, noise protection, water protection or biodiversity conservation are taken into account when approving facilities for the production and distribution of renewable energy. 1.3 FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND AND PEOPLE-FRIENDLY MOBILITY Green transport policy is key to improving the quality of life and protecting the environment. We want to avoid traffic, shift it to environmentally friendly means of transport and make it compatible with the landscape and neighborhoods. Despite our many successes, we are still a long way from reaching our goal. Over 30 percent of greenhouse gases and energy consumption are attributable to motorized transport. Noise and air pollution are a burden on health. Due to uninterrupted growth, transport is increasingly reaching the limits of capacity, affordability and acceptance. Instead of putting more and more money into expansion and sacrificing valuable cultivated land, the GREENS want to reduce traffic and direct it intelligently. Digitization is opening up new perspectives. However, the GREENS also see risks (Uber instead of public transport). We demand better framework conditions for sustainable mobility development and differentiated solutions for urban and rural areas. In the next legislative period, we want to achieve that: transport policy focuses on holism: it must use the potentials of spatial planning, traffic management, work organization, price control and technology for the benefit of climate- and people-friendly mobility. the agglomeration programs are strengthened in the new National Road Fund NAF. Half of the NAF funds are to flow into modal shift. the Federal Decree on Bicycles is implemented quickly. The bicycle must become a priority means of transport, especially in cities and agglomerations. no more new national roads are to be built. the polluter-pays principle is to be strengthened through the introduction of road pricing. This is intended to encourage people in heavily congested cities and conurbations to switch to environmentally friendly means of transportation (public transport, cycling, walking). municipalities are given greater autonomy in transport policy so that they can implement traffic calming measures in the interests of their residents. traffic areas for car traffic are reduced and used for the expansion of environmentally friendly means of transport (public transport, bicycles, pedestrian traffic) in order to promote the switch to environmentally friendly means of transport in heavily congested cities and agglomerations. the public transport pricing system is reformed: Public transport prices should be socially and family compatible and help to reduce peak loads on the infrastructure. financial resources for regional public transport should be secured. long-distance international rail services with attractive direct and night connections to all European capitals should be promoted as an alternative to flying. clear targets should be set for the digitization of mobility. For this must serve the people and the environment and not generate even more traffic or profit. the shift of freight traffic to the rails in the sense of the Alpine Initiative and the securing of routes for freight traffic on the entire rail network must be enforced. 1.4 FOR THE PROTECTION OF NATURE AND THE PRESERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY High-quality soil, forest, air and water form the basis for our health and biodiversity. The fragile ecosystem must be protected from overexploitation and endangerment. Thanks to the GREENS, a national biodiversity strategy has been developed. But the new rules of the game only work if they are implemented. There are sensitive gaps here. Protected areas, especially marshes, floodplains, dry grasslands, and amphibian spawning areas, are under increasing pressure. Not only bees, but also many other insect species are threatened. Environmental toxins and microplastics damage nature. The GREENS want to overcome short-sighted thinking. Switzerland was a pioneer in global environmental protection when it came to forest and water protection, the ban on phosphates or with the introduction of the catalytic converter. It should be again. In the next legislative period, we want to ensure that: the Swiss Biodiversity Strategy initiated by the Greens and the associated action plan are implemented with effective instruments and sufficient financial and human resources at the federal and cantonal levels. the goal of the popular initiative ""For clean drinking water and healthy food"" is achieved. The use of pesticides must be rapidly restricted by strengthening organic farming and an incentive tax. Particularly dangerous pesticides such as glyphosate or neonicotinoids are to be withdrawn from circulation immediately. the reduced VAT rates on pesticides are to be abolished and the limits for environmental toxins in the Water Protection Ordinance are to be lowered. the Bee Health Action Plan is to be implemented rapidly. Biodiversity on agricultural land increases again and biodiversity and networking contributions are only paid for measures that demonstrably protect biodiversity. Waters are renatured and ecologically upgraded more quickly and synergies with flood protection and spatial planning measures are used. Existing nature conservation areas are networked and expanded and a low-conflict coexistence of large carnivores and humans in the cross-border Alpine region is promoted. endangered species such as lynx, wolf, bear and beaver are to be preserved in viable populations. the federal government's neobiota strategy (combating alien species that threaten local biodiversity and ecosystems) is implemented quickly. we abandon environmentally harmful production and packaging materials (toxins, plastic bags, disposable containers, etc.) and replace them with environmentally friendly materials. A zero-waste strategy, which in particular stops the plastic input into the environment, is to be developed and implemented. the dangers of new technologies, such as nanotechnology, are to be researched in the sense of the precautionary principle and their risks assessed and consequences drawn from this. light pollution is to be combated in the same way as air or noise pollution. 1.5 FOR ECONOMICAL LAND USE AND CONSISTENT SPATIAL PLANNING Switzerland is becoming overbuilt: Almost one square meter of green space per second is disappearing under roads, shopping centers, parking lots and buildings. Eleven hectares of cultivated land are lost every day. To stop urban sprawl, the GREENS are at the forefront of protecting the countryside and cultivated land. We want to better protect scarce land and promote compact, family- and generation-friendly residential development in urban areas. We are fighting against backward steps in nature and heritage protection and want to put our green stamp on the next stage of the revision of the Spatial Planning Act. In the next legislative period, we want to achieve that: the revised spatial planning law (first part) is implemented on the basis of realistic population scenarios. the protection of cultivated land is strengthened, soil quality is improved, and building land and non-building land are separated. And that building outside the building zone is restricted in the second part of the revision of the Spatial Planning Act. a political majority is found for the popular initiative to stop the building boom in non-building areas. the Lex Weber (implementation of the second-home initiative) is strictly applied. the Lex Koller is tightened as a measure against land speculation with foreign capital. Commercial properties and real estate companies are also to fall under the Lex Koller. know-how about construction quality and construction culture for dense construction is to be expanded in professional training and among the responsible municipal authorities. Particular emphasis is also to be placed on knowledge about the indigenous building material wood. federal support for model projects for sustainable spatial development and for sustainable neighborhoods will be continued. Innovative approaches for inward settlement development, open space development in agglomerations, the promotion of affordable, socially mixed housing and eco-neighborhoods are to be promoted. green spaces, open spaces and urban garden areas in cities and agglomerations are preserved and enlarged. a further softening of nature and heritage protection and a further weakening of the right of associations to complain are prevented. nature reserves and nature parks are promoted and a strategy for the preservation of wilderness areas in Switzerland is developed. 2. THE GREENS ARE THE PARTY FOR AN ECONOMY WITH A FUTURE We GREENS want a fundamental change in economic policy. The economy must serve the people and not the other way around. This requires responsible use of resources, as called for by the Green Economy Initiative. Because natural production factors are becoming scarce and economic growth is reaching its limits, raw materials, labor, wages, assets, productivity gains and tax burdens must be distributed fairly - in Switzerland and also globally. The GREENS are driving the transformation to a social and ecological circular economy with responsible citizens, companies and social partners so that it becomes an opportunity for all. 2.1 FOR A GREEN ECONOMY WITHOUT CONTAMINATED SITES AND WASTE MOUNTAINS Today, Switzerland occupies an inglorious top position in the production of municipal waste and e-waste. And it is more dependent on energy and raw materials from other countries than almost any other country. It's no wonder that 73 percent of Switzerland's environmental pollution is now generated abroad. Far-sighted companies show that it is also possible without waste: Through clever planning and intelligent processes (circular economy), nature and budget are protected. International standards and the revision of procurement law ensure that environmental protection becomes a competitive advantage. The GREENS are convinced: Only with an environmentally compatible, globally responsible economy can Switzerland secure local jobs and prosperity in the long term. The economy needs the environment - and not the other way around. In the next legislature, we want to achieve that: a strategy is developed to strengthen the welfare economy with the goal of a good life as an alternative to the short-sighted growth economy. a new indicator is introduced that takes into account social cohesion and environmental quality and allows us to exit from the growth logic. the Green Economy Action Plan is renewed for the 2019-2023 legislature. The next stage must lead to a measurable reduction in the ecological footprint and the strengthening of the circular economy. To this end, the federal government should launch a program to promote innovative model projects for re-use, sharing and repair cycles. an innovation promotion program for the green economy is created - analogous to the energy promotion program (Swiss Competence Centers for Energy Research, SCCER). the local, social and solidarity economy and local businesses are promoted. Environmental protection and working conditions to be given greater consideration in the tendering process for public contracts. The sustainability potential of the new procurement law must be implemented by the federal government, cantons and municipalities. the Environmental Protection Act is revised to increase resource efficiency in Switzerland. The basis is the counter-proposal to the initiative for a green economy. long-lasting quality products are promoted by extending warranty periods and by imposing requirements to prevent planned waste (repair options, provision of spare parts, etc.). Imports of particularly environmentally harmful raw materials such as wood or palm oil from illegal deforestation should be stopped. consumers are better informed about the sustainability of products (labels for durability, economical use of resources or ease of repair). emissions from vehicles and appliances are continuously and bindingly reduced (top-runner principle). 2.2 FOR HEALTHY FOOD AND ORGANIC FARMING A good and healthy diet is important to people. But our food has the worm in it. More and more cheap products from agricultural factories and environmental toxins end up on our plates. We GREENS are committed to sustainably produced food, exemplary animal welfare and the strengthening of regional, seasonal products. Genetic engineering has no place on fields or in feed troughs. The quality of imported food must be improved through fair trade rules. Only with a green agricultural policy can we pass on healthy soils and animals to future generations. Smallholder farming structures and direct marketing channels between farmers and consumers must be strengthened worldwide. However, the agricultural turnaround also includes the elimination of environmentally harmful misguided incentives and subsidies. In the next legislature, we want to achieve that: the flat-rate income support is further reduced with the ""Agricultural Policy 2022-2026"". The state payments are to be used specifically for the sustainable production of food, for ecological and public services, for the maintenance of the cultivated landscape and for increased animal welfare. environmental pollution is reduced through site-appropriate, organic farming, technical innovations and incentive taxes on environmentally harmful additives such as pesticides. The environmental goals formulated in the ""Agricultural Policy 2014-2017"" must be enforced. animal welfare regulations are enforced and tightened while respecting religious freedom, including when importing animals or animal products from breeding, hunting and production. The goals of the initiative ""No factory farming in Switzerland"" and the initiative against products that are cruel to animals are supported. the genetic engineering moratorium is continued and the Genetic Engineering Act and the precautionary principle apply to new genetic engineering methods such as CRISPR/Cas 9. the origin, production method and sustainability of foodstuffs are better declared (climate label, compliance with Swiss animal welfare standards, etc.). a binding strategy against food waste is adopted. agricultural ecosystems are enhanced - to preserve soil fertility and store CO2. the motto ""fair trade not free trade"" applies: we want to protect local agricultural markets from dumping competition and destructive free trade agreements, both here and in the countries of the South. To this end, the Federal Council must finally implement the constitutional mandate for sustainable trade in the agricultural and food sector and use the existing trade instruments for sustainability. the Swiss plant breeding strategy is implemented by creating and financing a fund for ecological site-specific plant breeding. 2.3 FOR FAIR WORKING CONDITIONS AND INCOMES IN THE AGE OF DIGITALIZATION Green entrepreneurs show how to be successful with progressive work models, good wages and co-determination. Older employees, disadvantaged groups and people receiving disability benefits should also have a fair chance on the labor market. To achieve this, the fruits of labor must be distributed more equitably. Unfortunately, the wage gap has widened in recent years. The upper and top wages are growing faster than the lower ones. Wealth concentration is also on the rise. Digitalization is also increasing the requirements for flexibility and further training. Studies predict a job loss of 25 percent in Switzerland by 2030. Paving policy"" is no longer enough. A green transformation strategy for the digital world of work is needed. And there needs to be a serious debate about new forms of livelihood security outside of wage labor. For this purpose, the exchange of non-monetary benefits and gratuitousness are to be promoted. The digital working world will be more networked, more technical and more flexible. We GREENS also want it to be more humane, family-friendly and ecological. To achieve this, a move toward shorter working hours is essential. In the next legislative period, we want to ensure that: a national strategy for the social implementation of digitization is developed and implemented. All employees should have access to new technologies and a right to further training and retraining as industries and job profiles change. occupational health and safety is adapted to the digital world of work. Employees are to be protected from digital performance monitoring and constant accessibility and given more time autonomy and co-determination rights. Measures are taken against the precarious ""Uberization"". For the so-called platform economy, i.e. services mediated via the Internet, the usual labor law and social protection of employees must apply. This is also in the sense of a level playing field with ""analog"" companies. the pressure on companies to raise low wages and to stop self-enrichment in the executive suites is increasing. One means to this end is the expansion of the facilitated general applicability of collective labor agreements and the introduction of minimum wages, also for internships. the accompanying measures to protect local wages and working conditions are consistently implemented and strengthened. older employees are better protected through age-neutral job advertisements, the improvement of unemployment benefits from the age of 58 and the creation of a training fund. a Competence Center Inclusion is established to coordinate and strengthen financial and technical support for the integration of people with disabilities in the primary labor market. the first concrete steps are taken toward an unconditional basic income - as a response to job losses due to digitalization and artificial intelligence. 2.4 FOR A STRONG PUBLIC SERVICE AND A FAIR TAX POLICY We GREENS do not expect all salvation from the state, but trust first in the self-responsibility and innovative power of civil society. But one thing is clear: Existential goods such as water, energy, education, health care, but also public transport, postal services and communications, social security or technical infrastructures must be publicly planned and financed. This is the only way to make them accessible to all people and companies on fair terms. The GREENS demand that high-income earners, the wealthy and the business community contribute appropriately to the financing of public services. But where it says public service on the outside, it must also say public service on the inside. A great deal of trust was squandered with the Postbus scandal and the millions of euros spent on IT projects in the federal administration. Instead of privatization, what is needed is more leadership and more transparency on the part of the responsible authorities. In the next legislative period, we want to ensure that central goods such as water, energy supply and technical infrastructure remain in public hands. And that they are managed transparently, efficiently and sustainably. that corporate governance rules and supervision of services, wages and procurement for the federal administration and federal-affiliated companies are strengthened. that strategic infrastructures remain in Swiss majority ownership (extension of Lex Koller). that the basic provision of education, health, public transport and communications technology is ensured in all regions of Switzerland. that the tax system is harmonized to a greater extent - with the aim of eliminating the objectionable unequal treatment of citizens in the various cantons. Lump-sum taxation must be abolished. tax federalism is limited. This is to be achieved by means of national minimum rates for corporate taxes and better control of tax rulings and tax rebates granted by cantonal economic development agencies. a capital gains tax is to be introduced and the capital contribution principle (CTR II) and privileged dividend taxation (CTR I) are to be corrected. a revenue-neutral, individual taxation independent of civil status is to be introduced. the white money strategy and the automatic exchange of information are to be implemented with commitment. To this end, the tax authorities need sufficient staff. Switzerland is committed to enforcing the global BEPS standard (taxation at the place of performance) - as a measure against global location and tax dumping. Switzerland's economic policy should focus on strengthening innovation and not on siphoning off tax revenue from other countries. Switzerland is campaigning for the introduction of a European digital tax for companies in the platform economy. a national inheritance tax is introduced. 2.5 FOR STRONG CONSUMER PROTECTION AND FAIR COMPETITION Effective consumer protection is part of the Green economic policy. Only those who are transparently informed can choose sustainable, fair and healthy products and services. Switzerland is lagging behind the development. After all, digitization is rapidly changing the consumer world. Global online platforms like Amazon and Alibaba are flushing millions of products into Switzerland. In doing so, they exploit tax loopholes and a lack of controls to their own advantage. Deception, contract trickery and misuse of data are increasingly part of everyday life in Switzerland. They are actively promoted by companies (for example, Dieselgate) or by legislation. Advertising and the very weak declaration regulations also slow down sustainability in consumption. This must come to an end. Consumer protection and protection against unfair competition are to be strengthened in the next legislative period. In the next legislative period, we want to ensure that: technical consumer protection is strengthened. Durable, repairable products of high environmental quality with no expiration date planned by the manufacturer should become the norm. digital consumer protection is strengthened. Automated customer profiles may only be created digitally with the customer's consent and to a defined extent and must be used for a specific purpose in accordance with fair rules (and must be destroyed again). Digital services must also be accessible without creating customer profiles. The origin, production conditions and quality of goods and services are declared transparently. Social and ecological labels, also for goods and services imports (fair trade), are standardized and strengthened. A consumer-friendly insurance contract law without the possibility of unilaterally changing contract conditions or premiums is developed. Excessive profit margins in import and trade are reduced. This is to be done on the basis of a counter-proposal to the consumer protection organizations' fair price initiative. consumer protection associations are strengthened financially and a class action right against deception and fraud by companies is introduced. a level playing field (quality standards and tax burden) between global online retail giants and the local economy. food safety is also guaranteed in cross-border online trade. healthy and safe toys for children are also guaranteed in cross-border online trade. addictive, unhealthy or environmentally harmful products and services such as tobacco, alcohol or air travel are no longer advertised directly or indirectly. a federal law on the regulation of cannabis is being drafted. It is intended to regulate cultivation, trade, consumption, protection of minors and taxation, and to enable legal consumption. Platforms for the exchange of open data (Open Data) are supported in order to promote the development of new services by and for the population. 3. THE GREENS ARE THE PARTY OF DIVERSITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE Prosperity is usually confused with growth and wealth in official policy, but the affluent society is not the solution, it is the problem. But more and more people are no longer oriented solely toward material values, but are developing collective projects for a better quality of life and social cohesion. Community living, contract farming, time-sharing systems or sharing networks show that life is more than maximizing profit interests. The GREENS support these forward-looking approaches through political framework conditions and the strengthening of co-determination rights. To enable new forms of living and working, for example, progressive land and real estate policies are needed. And with open source solutions and digital citizens' rights, new communication and cultural platforms can be protected from commercialization and data misuse. The world is full of solutions. You just have to grab them. 3.1 FOR DIGITAL CITIZENS' RIGHTS AND CONSISTENT DATA PROTECTION Digitization has an impact on all areas of society. Network policy is therefore a cross-cutting task for the Greens. The GREENS want to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the information society, but also recognize the risks at an early stage. In the view of the Greens, the Internet is not just a technical tool, but a place of exchange that can and should also be used for more democratic co-determination and for a more sustainable society. The GREENS see the greatest need for action in network access, data protection, the reduction of energy and resource consumption by the technical infrastructure, and fair compensation for copyrights. We want a transparent state, not transparent citizens. In the next legislative period, we want to ensure that: a charter for digital citizens' rights is adopted. Among other things, it is intended to ensure that people are not excluded from access to goods, services or participation in social life as a result of digitalization or that machines cannot be programmed to make unethical decisions. privacy is adequately protected by a new data protection law. The law should enshrine basic digital rights such as the right to erasure and set limits on the sharing and linking of data (Big Data). an efficient open network for all is created, with net neutrality guaranteed by law. And affordable access to high-bandwidth Internet is available throughout Switzerland. fundamental rights such as freedom of expression or freedom of information are only interfered with if there is a legal basis and a court order. And if the interventions are necessary and proportionate. We reject the secret spying on computers and the use of state Trojans without reasonable suspicion or for stockpiling. cybersecurity does not become a cover for a new edition of the snooping state. Data retention without any reason must be stopped. In contrast, protection against cyberbullying and digital agitation is to be expanded. The dignity and integrity of people must be protected by the operators of public platforms. the federal government increasingly uses open-source solutions and consistently fairly manufactured, environmentally compatible hardware. To this end, the leeway provided by the new Public Procurement Act is also to be used. alternative remuneration models for the unlawful private use of copyrighted works (for example, when uploading to file sharing networks) are to be developed. The Greens consider law enforcement and access barriers to be the wrong means. 3.2 FOR MEDIA DIVERSITY, DEMOCRATIC OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY Switzerland is proud of its democratic tradition. But there is a need for reform. For example, many political parties are financed by controversial corporations. Often, corporate lobbyists sit in parliament in person and represent particular interests instead of the common good. The GREENS were the first party to establish ethical guidelines for party donations and transparency of funds. Such rules of the game are also needed at the national level for elections and campaigns. In addition, equal opportunities and the protection of minorities must finally be enforced in the electoral system. Media diversity is also one of the foundations of democracy. This is in danger due to digitization, media concentration and the reduction of quality and services. In the next legislature, we want to achieve that: a party financing is introduced that enables all parties to have a level playing field in terms of basic services. And reducing dependence on private lobbies. a yes to the transparency initiative co-launched by the GREENS will enable the introduction of guidelines for the financing of elections and political campaigns. a detailed disclosure requirement will apply to donations and compensation in connection with vested interests and lobbying activities in parliament. a binding federal regulation will apply for the protection of political minorities in small cantons with a majoritarian electoral system. the federal government will advocate an electronic signature system for initiatives and referendums. the voting age of 16 is introduced and a campaign is carried out to promote media education and media skills among adolescents and young adults. the right to a political voice and participation also applies to people with a foreign passport. independent journalistic media services as well as media diversity and media quality are specifically promoted with the new media law. a new constitutional basis is created for direct media funding for private offerings. To ensure that the diversity, quality and democratic relevance of the media are preserved. formulate a strategy for the renewal of public service media (SRG and regional private) in the age of digitization. The public service must open up to society and reflect the diversity of opinions and realities of life. measures are taken to detect fake news campaigns and a quality label is created for Internet platforms. 3.3 FOR VIBRANT NEIGHBORHOODS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CITIES AND AGGLOMERATIONS Cities are engines of change and laboratories for innovation. The economical use of land must bring living and working together again and promote inward settlement development. The motto is to grow and add more. However, it will only be accepted if the quality of life is right and affordable housing is maintained. The GREENS are more committed than any other party to urban green and open spaces and a high-quality planning and building culture. We also want to stop land and housing speculation, because that is the only way to have affordable rents and space for neighborhoods, families and public meeting places. For the Greens, housing is a fundamental right. However, a green transport policy is also crucial for life in cities and agglomerations. The federal government cannot delegate all these tasks to the municipalities and cantons, but must take on more responsibility itself. In the next legislature, we want to achieve that: the federal government is more committed to densification and upgrading in urban areas. These include minimum regulations for the utilization and occupancy of land, the promotion of modular construction, and the safeguarding of public green spaces in neighborhoods and agglomerations (playgrounds, parks, and open spaces). planning requirements for the preservation of affordable housing in cities and agglomerations will be implemented in the second stage of the revision of the Spatial Planning Act. These include, for example, minimum quotas for affordable residential and commercial space or cooperatives as well as a right of first refusal for municipalities. the federal government makes land reserves from SBB, armasuisse and other federally related companies available to non-profit housing developers at low cost. the promotion of non-profit housing construction is intensified and tenancy law is strengthened (control of initial rents, mandatory use of forms, better protection against dismissal). The Greens want to help the tenants' association's housing initiative achieve a breakthrough. In the case of renovations and conversions, only investments that increase the value of the property in real terms can be added to the rent. The possibility to pass on 50-70 percent of the costs for overall renovations is to be abolished. the framework credit for the Fonds de Roulement to promote low-interest loans for social housing is to be increased by 500 million francs. The federal government, cantons and cities promote flexible, intergenerational forms of housing and ecological neighborhoods. A cross-departmental and cross-office agency for neighborhood development is to accompany the projects and processes. Following the clear Yes to the Federal Cycling Decree, more federal funds should be used for cycling in cities and conurbations and for improving road safety, particularly on school routes. 3.4 FOR NEW PERSPECTIVES IN MOUNTAIN AREAS The GREENS are well represented in the cities and agglomerations. But green policies are also needed in rural cantons and mountain regions. Climate heating presses tourism and agriculture. Only a forward strategy will bring new perspectives to mountain areas. In doing so, they can build on existing strengths: the unique landscapes, the cultural wealth, the (still scarcely) comprehensive public service and a strongly rooted population. Sustainable economic impulses can be set with a reform of tourism structures, with green energy or with new forms of marketing for regional products. Digitization is also bringing new opportunities to peripheral regions. The more open people are to change, the more positive it can be. In the next legislative period, we want to achieve that: political participation, the ability to renew and the future orientation in the mountain areas are strengthened through the reform of the electoral systems (proportional representation) and through mergers of municipalities. the federal government actively supports the structural change in the mountain areas (as an alternative to the construction of second homes and unecological major events such as the Olympic Games). The next stage of the ""New Regional Policy"" must focus even more on sustainable tourism and strengthening regional economic cycles. A program for the energy-efficient refurbishment of the building stock is intended to secure decentralized training and jobs. hydropower will remain in public hands in the future. Home waste is to be recorded in cantonal companies that are committed to a sustainable strategy in the sense of an energy turnaround that is compatible with nature and the landscape. This also includes the use of solar energy, wind energy and biomass. adequate water rates are guaranteed and the strategic reserve maintenance of reservoirs is compensated. The latter is intended to strengthen not only security of supply but also economic value creation in the Alpine regions. basic services in the areas of education, health, communications and public transport are safeguarded and modernized despite pressure to cut costs, in order to stop emigration. Digitization is an opportunity for mountain regions. the shift target for transalpine freight traffic enshrined in the constitution is implemented without compromise. The GREENS demand the rapid introduction of the Alpine transit exchange and the securing of rail routes for the growing freight traffic. The second Gotthard road tube must not lead to an increase in capacity. 4. THE GREENS ARE THE PARTY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES The GREENS are committed to a political culture that combines individual freedom with social responsibility. We are convinced that a pluralistic society can only function on the foundation of the rule of law and in mutual respect and openness. Equal opportunities and the rights of minorities are also cornerstones of modern democracy. Growing inequalities in wages, wealth or education are increasingly calling social cohesion into question. We Greens want to strengthen social safety nets so that no one falls through the cracks. A good public service ensures education, health care and the compatibility of work and family for all. 4.1 FOR SOCIAL SECURITY IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND A MODERN FAMILY POLICY No party has shaped the opening up of society in Switzerland as much as the GREENS. Whether people live together in shared apartments, go through life as patchwork families or as same-sex couples fortunately no longer causes an outcry today. The coexistence of the generations has also become more diverse. Now, social support and safety nets must also be adapted to the new realities of life. Green social policy is no longer focused on the traditional family, but takes into account the diversity of life situations and the principle of equality. It is also guided by a central constitutional principle: the strength of the people is measured by the welfare of the weak. There is a lot to do here. In the next legislature, we want to achieve that: social policy is reformed so that parents and children can lead an economically secure life regardless of the family model, income or origin. In particular, care work must be taken into account in maintenance and pension arrangements (for example, the introduction of care credits in occupational pension schemes), and tax deductions must be replaced by a more socially equitable allowance system. In the event of illness of the parent providing care, the external childcare that is then necessary must be financed. a national framework law for social welfare and supplementary benefits for families must be introduced. parental leave of 28 weeks must be introduced (financed via the income replacement scheme), of which at least eight weeks must be taken by the father. the ""AHV 21"" project and the reform of the occupational pension scheme must be oriented towards the goal of enabling a dignified life in old age. The one-time increased financial needs of the baby boom generation are to be absorbed by an AHV state fund. a retirement à la carte is made possible, which takes better account of the retirement age and the health burden in working life. Retirement models are to enable a gradual transition to retirement on the basis of the reference age of 64/65. Older unemployed people should be able to remain in their pension fund. the social participation of people with disabilities is strengthened. Educational institutions, the labor market, public space, mobility services and social insurance must be further developed in such a way that people with disabilities can lead a dignified life that is as self-determined as possible. 4.2 FOR SOCIALLY FINANCED HEALTH CARE 13 percent of the gross domestic product, i.e. around 10,000 Swiss francs per inhabitant, is spent annually on our health. A rich country can cope with this as a community of solidarity - if it manages the costs properly. Although most of us are satisfied with our family doctor, the hospital in our region or our physiotherapist, the health care system is suffering from more and more ailments: For many insured people, premiums are no longer affordable. Funding for elder care is particularly confusing and misaligned with incentives; too little is being done to prevent or delay illness. Care is fragmented, and patients are often shuffled back and forth in an uncoordinated manner. And there is still too much, unnecessary or insufficient treatment. All these problems cannot be improved with more market. Because health does not function according to the principle of competition. Instead, smart government rules are needed for social balance, cost containment and health promotion. We Greens have good recipes for this. In the next legislative period, we want to achieve that: five percent of the premium money is used for projects and measures of health promotion and medical prevention. the premiums do not exceed ten percent of the household income. The cantons must be obliged to pay at least as much to the premium reduction as the federal government does and to adjust the contributions to the development of costs. In recent years, premium reductions have become the plaything of cantonal austerity policies. This must come to an end. the financing of geriatric care is reformed. For flexible models of care for the elderly - at home, in assisted living, in nursing homes, for dementia - adapted financing and remuneration instruments must be created. a strategy for the promotion of integrated care models is developed. The increasing specialization of medicine is leading to even more interfaces in the treatment chain. The health insurance law is intended to oblige health care providers to cooperate more closely. Care coordination and patient support in the treatment process must be remunerated. The promotion of complementary medicine in application, teaching and research makes a greater contribution to cost-effective and holistic health care. The development of treatment paths and treatment guidelines prevents unnecessary and inappropriate treatments. drug approvals, medical planning and public research are made independent of the direct or indirect financing of the pharmaceutical industry (external experts, commissions and teaching of medicine included). public cantonal or a public national health insurance fund is introduced, which is responsible for all services covered by the compulsory health insurance. 4.3 FOR THE EQUALITY OF WOMEN AND MEN AND MORE GENDER JUSTICE The GREENS are the pioneers of equality policy. We did our homework earlier and more consistently than any other party. Half of all Green seats in parliaments and executives are now held by women. Equality is also a matter of course in management bodies. In politics and business, on the other hand, this goal is far from being achieved. Women are underrepresented in many professions and face discrimination in wages and pensions. We GREENS are committed to a better reconciliation of work and family life, against sexism, for equal pay and the upgrading of social professions. For us, equality is not simply a women's issue. Men also want to free themselves from the traditional role corset and are committed to green equality policies. In the next legislature, we want to achieve that: every person can freely choose gender and does not have to decide to live as a woman or a man. overcoming gender stereotypes in family, education, training and work leads to more freedom of choice. This requires concrete projects and innovative campaigns in various areas of society. family and career are more compatible. This requires a right to affordable childcare places for all, but also more family-friendly training and work models (flexible working hours, home office) and sufficient day schools. employers should be more involved in the financing of supplementary family childcare - as the canton of Vaud is doing. This is the only way to prevent middle-class family budgets from declining due to high care rates despite second incomes. Parents to be better protected against discrimination in the labor market. part-time jobs for men are promoted. weekly working hours are reduced to reconcile gainful employment, family work, housework, social commitment and leisure time. job sharing is promoted, especially in management positions. equal pay between women and men is enforced. This requires a campaign against gender stereotypes in career choice and training and binding wage analyses and controls. a minimum representation of women in management functions in the federal administration and in federally-affiliated companies applies and gender benchmarks in companies are enforced. the balanced representation of both genders in the Federal Council and in the national parliament is made binding. Women's shelters should be given greater support, child protection and victim assistance should be expanded within the framework of the Istanbul Convention, and support should also be given to prevention projects and low-threshold services in the area of work with perpetrators. schools should strengthen equality and self-determination instead of cementing traditional gender roles. 4.4 FOR BROAD ACCESS TO EDUCATION, TRAINING AND CULTURE Switzerland is poor in raw materials, but rich in innovative spirit and culture. These thrive only in a climate of openness and tolerance. And they thrive on the cross-border exchange of ideas and people. We GREENS want to defend the international partnerships of universities, universities of applied sciences, research and culture against the right-wing nationalist foreclosure policy and the austerity apologists. However, we also oppose the tendency to privatize knowledge and focus on short-term economic benefits. The GREENS stand for a holistic, diverse, integrative education system and a high-level and networked research and cultural center in Switzerland. The vocational training pathway with vocational baccalaureate and universities of applied sciences should be on an equal footing with the academic education pathway. Those who missed out on entering an apprenticeship program should be given a second chance. In the next legislative period, we want to achieve that: sufficient funds are available for education and training at all levels of the federal education system. education for sustainable development is strengthened and the promotion of personal and social competencies in the sense of ""soft skills"" is upheld even in the age of digitalization. equal opportunities in education and training are promoted through the expansion and harmonization of the scholarship system as well as family and in-service study programs. Social assistance for young people is to be replaced by scholarships. the willingness of companies to train is to be more strongly promoted and recognized, for example with a bonus-malus system in the health sector or in public procurement. Young people and adults without vocational qualifications are given a second chance. Vocational schools should remain free of charge even if apprenticeships are started late, and companies should be encouraged to offer post-qualifications through incentives. Sans-Papiers children can continue to attend school or complete an apprenticeship. Swiss participation in the European research and cultural programs will be continued. Swiss participation in European exchange programs for pupils and students is continued and extended to vocational education and training. transparent and clear regulations for sponsorship contracts and for additional income of senior university employees apply at all universities. the financial resources for the 2021-2024 cultural message and the 2021-2024 framework credit for education, research and innovation are secured. 4.5 FOR A DEMOCRACY WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION, EXCLUSION AND RACISM The GREENS are at the forefront of advocating respect for human rights and the protection of minorities. No one should be discriminated against or excluded on the basis of origin, age, religion, gender, lifestyle, sexual orientation, physical or mental limitations, or language. Already 20 years ago, the GREENS demanded marriage for all in parliament. The motion did not find a majority at the time, but it paved the way for registered partnerships. Now it is high time for the next step. The GREENS are convinced that equality, tolerance, diversity and mutual respect are the guiding principles for good coexistence. We want a society in which everyone has a place and can help shape the way we live together. In the next legislature, we want to achieve that: marriage is fully opened to same-sex couples and they are equal in the adoption procedure and in reproductive medicine. married couples, registered partnerships and cohabiting couples are treated equally in tax and social security law. a ""third gender"" is introduced and the reference to gender is dispensed with in legal provisions, with the exception of areas where the indication of gender is mandatory (for example in the case of pregnancy). the naturalization of bi-national couples in registered partnerships is facilitated and the persecution and discrimination of LGBTIQ* people are recognized as grounds for asylum in the asylum procedure. gender-assigning surgeries without medical necessity are banned for intersexual children. a broad campaign against racist, sexist or homo- and transphobic content on social media is carried out. strong protection against discrimination based on origin, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity (LGBTIQ*) is guaranteed. violence based on race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity (LGBTIQ*) is statistically recorded. This recording is also to be extended to areas of structural racism, as is the case with racial profiling. interreligious dialog is promoted and religious freedom is guaranteed within the framework of fundamental constitutional rights. an action plan is drawn up for the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Disability Equality Act. This should include and implement clear and demonstrable goals such as accessible services at all levels of government, as well as in the private sector and media. 5. THE GREENS ARE THE PARTY OF OPENNESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS Globalization is changing the role of democratic states. Unilateral trade agreements and investment protection treaties undermine the rights of citizens and place them in the hands of large international corporations. The GREENS want to steer globalization in ecological, social and democratic directions. As a highly networked business location and global financial center, Switzerland has a special role to play here. Switzerland's economic policy should strengthen sustainable development, corporate responsibility and fair trade. And it should make its humanitarian tradition, human rights and peacebuilding the guiding principles of its foreign policy. 5.1 FOR GOOD NEIGHBORLINESS WITH EUROPE AND THE WORLD The GREENS are committed to good relations with our neighboring countries and fairer rules for global markets. Switzerland should be a reliable partner in the international community and make a committed contribution to the promotion of democracy, prosperity, peace, security and the preservation of the ecological basis of life. There is great pressure for action in Europe. Switzerland is a part of Europe. Together with our European sister parties, we GREENS strive for a democratically, socially and ecologically renewed Europe with respect for human rights. In the next legislature, we want to achieve that: the bilateral path is strengthened through a fair framework agreement and closer cooperation, especially in the areas of education, research and environmental protection. The protection of wages and working conditions must be strengthened in the process. Switzerland, together with the EU authorities, enforces the local principle over the principle of origin (Cassis-de-Dijon). Only in this way can we prevent social and ecological dumping and thus a division of Europe. the UN Sustainable Development Goals are implemented by Switzerland in an exemplary manner. Switzerland is increasingly committed to a social, ecological and peace-promoting policy of international organizations. It must also invest at least 0.7 percent of GDP in development cooperation. Switzerland's contribution to the international climate fund is not financed from the development budget, but rather by a CO2 levy on combustibles and fuels in line with the polluter-pays principle. better rules of play apply to the globally active financial markets to prevent bankruptcies, crashes and government bailouts. Capital requirements must be tightened further and trading in financial products and commodities must be better monitored and controlled. Switzerland should not only comply with international law, but also play an active role in the fight against global tax havens and financial market risks. One key step is the introduction of a global financial transaction tax. 5.2 FOR PEACE POLICY AND DISARMAMENT No other party has rejected the procurement of new fighter aircraft as clearly as the GREENS. The success of the Gripen referendum was the prelude to further army reforms. But the slide to the right in 2015 has turned the reform zeal into its opposite. For the GREENS, it is clear that the army must be greatly reduced and must not take over any civilian tasks. The response to the increase in global conflicts should not be rearmament, but an expansion of civil peacebuilding and a strict ban on arms exports. Because only the UN can form a basis for world peace, we call for its strengthening against military alliances such as NATO, which represent not universal but special interests. Banning weapons from the private sphere is also intended to improve domestic security. In the next legislative period, we want to achieve that: Switzerland is committed to an international agreement for the worldwide outlawing of fully autonomous weapons systems (robotic weapons). Switzerland immediately ratifies the international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The agreement provides for a ban on the development and stockpiling of nuclear weapons and the threat of their use. a Yes to the initiative ""For a ban on the financing of war material producers"" co-launched by the Young Greens, thus preventing investment in the arms industry. the army and the military budget should be reduced. compulsory military service is abolished. the service can be provided on a part-time basis in order to accommodate modern family models and part-time workers. a new, oversized fighter jet procurement is prevented. the army will refrain from internal and civilian operations and from military missions abroad. Internal security is the task of a well-trained police force. Civilian service is equal to military service and is also open to women and foreigners on a voluntary basis . all arms exports are banned. all arms and military cooperation with the entire Middle East is stopped. Switzerland withdraws from NATO's Partnership for Peace and instead becomes more involved in the UN and the OSCE. the long-standing commitment to a just peace between Israel and Palestine is resumed. Ordnance weapons are stored in armories or shooting ranges and all weapons are registered. 5.3 FOR FAIR TRADE AND RIGHTS WITHOUT BORDERS Switzerland is networked with the global economy like almost no other country. As a country poor in raw materials, it is particularly dependent on exchange and global sustainability. At the same time, it is home to the largest offshore financial center and the second largest commodity trading center in the world. For the Greens, it is clear that this special role comes with corresponding responsibility. Multinationals based in Switzerland must promote sustainable development and human rights worldwide. To ensure that unchecked globalization does not lead to more losers and national isolation, fair rules of the game must promote the acceptance and sustainability of global trade. Poverty, hardship and precarious migration can only be stopped with ""rights without borders"". In the next legislative period, we want to achieve a ""yes"" vote on the corporate responsibility initiative and an effective counter-proposal. There is a need for binding corporate liability and due diligence to uphold global human, environmental and labor rights. more transparency prevails in the extractive sector. For this purpose, in particular the country- and project-specific payments for trading in commodities as well as the ownership structure must be disclosed in the cantonal commercial registers. a supervisory authority for trading in commodities and foodstuffs (Rohma) is created. raw materials, products and services are traceable along the entire production and supply chain. speculation with foodstuffs and land grabbing are prohibited. existing international agreements such as the Basel Convention on the Disposal and Transport of Waste are extended to the production and trade of raw materials. all new Swiss trade agreements are supplemented with a sustainability chapter to enforce international environmental protection and human rights treaties. Switzerland advocates at the WTO that production methods (PPM) can be taken into account in the design of trade rules. the new federal constitutional mandate on food security is implemented. Cross-border trade relations must contribute to the sustainable development of the agricultural and food sector. 5.4 FOR A HUMANE MIGRATION AND ASYLUM POLICY Never since the Second World War have so many people been on the run as today. For the Greens, it is clear that Switzerland, as the depositary state of 79 international treaties and in particular the Geneva Convention, must and can make a significant contribution to international solidarity. The answer to the increasing crises must be more aid, more support on the ground and a committed fight against the causes of flight. Those who come to Europe and Switzerland in search of security and prospects are entitled to a fair trial and social solidarity. In the next legislature, we want to achieve that: Switzerland is more committed to addressing the deep-rooted causes of war, persecution, flight and precarious migration. It must implement the UN's Sustainable Development Goals and commit itself to fair global economic relations, the implementation of the Paris climate agreement and a foreign policy that promotes peace. Switzerland's humanitarian tradition is respected without any ifs or buts. Switzerland must advocate within Europe for humane treatment of refugees and should participate in rescue operations in the Mediterranean. Switzerland advocates safe escape routes and reintroduces embassy asylum. Switzerland should advocate for a redesign of the Dublin system so that the personal circumstances of people fleeing can be taken into account (family relationships, language skills, level of education); so that the economic performance and demographics of a country are decisive for the distribution of refugees - and not the place of arrival of the same; so that particularly vulnerable people (pregnant women, families, sick people) are no longer sent back due to the Dublin regulation. a fair asylum policy committed to fundamental rights is implemented. Asylum seekers have the right to a legally correct and expeditious procedure with independent legal representation. Asylum grounds such as sexual orientation, gender identity or discrimination against women must be given greater consideration. enforcement detention for migrants in Switzerland is abolished. legal immigration opportunities are created for people from third countries (without restriction to managers, specialists and qualified workers). asylum seekers, provisionally admitted persons and rejected persons for whom repatriation is not possible are quickly integrated into the labor market. Switzerland increases the refugee quotas within the framework of the UNHCR, giving special consideration to unaccompanied minor asylum seekers. Basic rights also apply to Sans-Papiers. We demand a collective regularization of all Sans-Papiers who have lived in Switzerland for four years. Human trafficking and modern slavery are being fought throughout Switzerland and the number of convictions is increasing. In order to increase the number of reports, sufficient contact persons are needed in addition to the national reporting office. Furthermore, a specific penal norm is needed for labor exploitation that occurs outside the context of human trafficking. Last but not least, public awareness must be intensified and coordinated at the national level."
43120,200710,"Assume responsibility and live and politicize respectfully We see politics as a comprehensive approach to the participation of our social coexistence. We want to assume our responsibility and make moderate use of our scarce natural and financial resources. The goal is to keep the sustainability triangle of environmental, social and economic issues in balance. Since we will continue to depend on an intact environment and healthy finances in the future, we must not live at the expense of future generations in any area. We therefore want to overcome the conventional left-right scheme. The state has to create the conditions so that later generations can live in such a way that they do not have to pay off mortgages from our time. To this end, we want to work primarily with market-based instruments and incentive taxes. These must create incentives for moderation. Prohibitions and commandments are to be used only secondarily. We want to pursue our goals by treating each other with mutual respect. The Green Liberals pursue a fact-based policy. 1. environment We all depend on an intact environment as a basis for life. Therefore, we also understand environmental protection as the protection of people. We see the avoidance of environmental damage as an important contribution to the survival of mankind. We want to leave our neighbors a world worth living in, without legacy burdens. Future generations should also be able to have fun and enjoy life! 1.1 Energy and climate In terms of sustainability, energy should primarily be used efficiently and saved in all areas. Energy that is not consumed does not have to be produced in some way first. Our society will always depend on energy as a key resource. This should be produced as CO2-neutral, renewable and alternative as possible with the most modern and efficient technologies. (Keywords: Hydropower, wood, solar, wind, biogas, geothermal, combined heat and power, hydrogen). The state should control this with incentive taxes, sensitization and setting an example instead of prohibitions. In this way, we protect our climate and preserve the limited amount of valuable oil for our future. Nuclear power plants (NPPs), with their risks and waste issues, are neither an economic nor an ecological solution. No new nuclear power plants are to be built, nor are the existing operating licenses to be extended. The repository issue must be approached in a participatory manner. As soon as the amount of high-level waste to be stored has been defined by a clear decision to phase it out, a suitable site for a deep geological repository should be evaluated, if possible in Switzerland. Green Liberal Party Switzerland P.O. Box 367 3000 Bern 7 Tel 031 322 60 57 schweiz@grunliberale.ch www.grunliberale.ch 1.2 Air Good air quality is a basic requirement for our existence and part of our quality of life. We therefore want the Clean Air Ordinance (LRV) to be consistently complied with (ozone, particulate matter, hydrocarbons, etc.) The CO2 tax is also urgently needed for fuels and must be able to have a steering effect in terms of its level. A climate cap may only serve as a supplement. 1.3 Airport We are also in favor of an ecologically compatible airport as a locational advantage for our economic region. However, in order to maintain the quality of life for the people, we demand clear framework conditions: from an ecological point of view, it would be desirable to cap the number of aircraft movements at 250,000 per year. Realistically enforceable are 320,000 movements per year and in the sense of a pragmatic solution, the Green Liberals accept this. We demand seven hours of night-time rest and a restriction to flights that are important for Switzerland as a business location in the night-time hours of 22-23 h and from 06:00 - 07:00 and no capacity-increasing changes to the existing runway system. A new set of operating regulations must not unhinge the valid spatial planning and must bring relief to all affected cantons as a whole. Within these guard rails, we stand by an efficient international airport. In principle, the railroad should be given priority. 1.4 Transport and spatial planning We want to bring living, leisure, shopping and working closer together. This reduces the need for mobility. The necessary mobility in our society should be handled as ecologically as possible. Ecologically oriented spatial planning prevents undesirable developments in traffic with environmental damage. Sustainable mobility with true costs also takes external costs into account. It encourages people to switch to public transport (PT). Instead of building new roads, public transport must be specifically promoted, e.g. with a redirection of fuel duty money for an increase in funding for the further development of the OeV infrastructure, the extensions of suburban railroad systems and the connection to the high-speed railroads of the EU. The car should be used responsibly, moderately and on one's own responsibility. Our modern society needs a healthy measure of sensible mobility in all areas. Transit goods belong consistently on the railroads so that truck traffic does not continue to increase. In order to enforce environmental law, the right of associations to lodge complaints is a pragmatic and effective approach that must take effect in the event of omissions by the authorities and should not be delegated to the level of private complaints. 1.5 Nature and agriculture We want to preserve nature in its natural, original, free landscapes and maintain biodiversity, but also maintain or promote important recreational areas and green oases in the settlement area. In 20 years, the agglomerations around the larger cities should still be attractive areas with an intact landscape where people can live, work and feel comfortable. In the peripheral areas, a high level of consideration for the landscapes as recreational areas is necessary, yet there should be room for ecologically compatible tourism. This is the only way to preserve our quality of life and Switzerland's high attractiveness as a business location. We support a GMO-free, organic agriculture with contemporary animal welfare that produces healthy food. We are against pure structural preservation and are committed to an agriculture that functions according to the motto: quality instead of quantity. We advocate the careful use of water and support the renaturation of watercourses. 2. finances and economy We want a state that does not leave our children mountains of debt. It should function like a modern service company. It should not be further inflated (more personal responsibility) and used as a solution for all social and economic problems. Nevertheless, we stand by our state - efficient and focused on core tasks. For us, this includes all tasks related to the security of supply of the population (e.g. public transport, water, electricity). Privatisations of state-owned enterprises should be approached defensively and examined carefully. We expect business leaders to act ethically and responsibly toward people and the environment. The state should actively support and promote innovative SMEs and spinoffs (business), (e.g. with incentives such as an innovation risk guarantee). This makes qualitative, sustainable growth possible. A sustainable policy also includes finances. The state should not spend more than it takes in and should set clear spending priorities. Necessary reorganizations of the public financial budget with the existing structural problems, should be done with targeted waiver planning. The tax rate must not be a taboo here. The goal at all levels must be a stable tax rate in the long term and countercyclical behavior. We want to restructure the financial system with an ecological tax reform and simplify it as much as possible overall. 3. social affairs, education and health 3.1 Social services In emergency situations, everyone should receive the support they need to live in dignity. The state should promote personal achievement, a sense of responsibility, solidarity and neighborly help, and not take all responsibility away from the responsible individual. State support should be perceived with moderation, reasonableness and always with a view to helping people help themselves. Appropriate incentives must be created for this. 3.2 Family Children must not be a risk of poverty. There is a need for more modern services such as lunch counters, supplementary benefits for families, day schools and more part-time positions at all levels - also for men. The state should not relieve families of their child-rearing responsibilities, but it should support them in doing so. 3.3 Asylum and foreigners Switzerland has a humanitarian tradition: humane, reasonable, balanced and solidary. We need short procedures. Abuses must be combated in a targeted manner. Swiss and foreigners must do their part and make a mutual effort to integrate - in keeping with our right to hospitality. Problems of integration must be addressed openly and pragmatically. We want to enable targeted immigration - in line with the needs of our society and economy. In the sense of targeted development work, temporary stays for foreigners from poor countries for training purposes should also be possible. After their return, they are to apply what they have learned in their home country. 3.4 Education/school Education is an important resource - we take this fact seriously! We need a comprehensive and intercantonally coordinated education with head, hand, heart for all. There should also be better coordination and more sustained investment in higher education and research. This will enable us to maintain our leading position worldwide and create jobs. 3.5 Health Sickness and death are part of life. The confrontation with one's own finiteness and the technical possibilities of prolonging life is necessary. We are otherwise creating an ultimately unaffordable health care system. The Green Liberals want a level playing field for alternative and conventional medicine, prevention instead of expensive repair, eliminating the causes instead of fighting the symptoms, and promoting personal responsibility. 4. europe Primarily, we see the bilateral way today. Therefore, Yes to Bilateral Agreements II and Yes to the implementation of Bilateral Agreements I in the new EU member states. Whether further bilateral agreements will be possible remains to be seen. That is why accession to the EU will have to be reassessed later. However, this must be well prepared."
43120,201110,"With the introduction of an energy tax on non-renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy saving and renewable energies become economically interesting. The abolition of the complicated value-added tax frees value creation from taxes. Overall, the initiative strengthens innovation, reduces administration at companies and the state. Consumption of oil, gas and nuclear power will fall, CO2 emissions will be reduced: Billions in value added will also remain at home instead of flowing abroad. The fixed linkage of the revenue to the gross domestic product ensures a state-quota-neutral implementation. Energy Climate protection and nuclear phase-out We Green Liberals are in favor of effective climate protection and a gradual phase-out of nuclear energy. We want to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources instead of consuming finite resources because we see the changeover as a great opportunity. We want to put our country on the path to a 2000-watt society and get by with significantly less energy while maintaining the same quality of life. Not with bans or subsidies, but with liberal financial incentives, such as our ""Energy instead of VAT"" initiative. Economy Strong economy with responsibility Performance and economic success should be rewarded. Innovative entrepreneurs and self-reliant employees are guarantors for the successful development of our economy. Entrepreneurial freedom is inextricably linked to ethics and responsibility for one's own behavior and its consequences. A framework is needed for the social and ecological moderation of the economy. We demand the strengthening of shareholder rights, transparency and security. This also strengthens Switzerland's position as a business and financial center in international competition. Liberal society Personal responsibility and equal opportunities Green liberal thinking is self-responsible, open to different realities and a plurality of values. This manifests itself in tolerance and appreciation of those who think differently, other religions, cultures and different ways of life. Green Liberal means equal opportunities without egalitarianism. Green Liberal means recognizing and enabling the diversity of social and family forms. The child-rearing activities of men and women should be compatible with a career, but should place as little burden on the state as possible. Spatial planning & traffic Space for quality of life Beautiful landscapes and valuable cultivated land characterize Switzerland. To preserve them, we want to stop the ongoing urban sprawl. We therefore support effective measures such as the landscape initiative, densification in the centers and the levy on added value. The growing mobility must be questioned as it affects our quality of life, the environment and the landscape. We want to curb growth by making mobility prices more user-friendly. Our ""energy tax instead of value-added tax"" initiative provides effective incentives here. Education & Research Investment in education brings innovation Education and research are our most important resources. Commitment, courage, openness to new things and personal responsibility together with a good education are the cornerstones of a modern and achievement-oriented society. We Green Liberals want to invest in our locational advantage with optimal educational opportunities for all social classes. The unique dual education system together with the successful university location are the central basis for a healthy economy. Innovation parks create space for development and innovation. Social sustainability Social services in financial equilibrium Our social security systems are designed to protect pensioners, the disabled and the unemployed - today and in the future. Similar to the debt brake, we need to introduce rules to ensure the sustainable balance of social services between benefits and revenues. Each generation must assume its responsibility and not pass on costs to future generations. Solidarity and a willingness to perform are inseparable. This is the only way to ensure social security. Growth Keeping things in moderation - for people and nature Switzerland enjoys a high level of prosperity, which we want to preserve for future generations. We therefore focus more on quality than quantity. We question whether more and more consumption, more and more living space or more and more mobility really brings more quality of life. Frugality can mean a better quality of life and conserves our planet's scarce resources. The path towards a 2000-watt society points the way here. Migration Open, but not limitless Switzerland has a humanitarian tradition. Asylum seekers threatened with life and limb should be granted the right of residence in Switzerland. Faster procedures and a consistent fight against abuses are in everyone's interest here. A highly skilled workforce is essential for an innovative economy. That is why we stand by the free movement of persons and targeted immigration from third countries. At the same time, we want to develop solutions for the associated challenges such as housing shortages, pressure on infrastructure and wages. Health Healthy system thanks to sensible measures Health is the most valuable asset of every human being. However, the health care system must remain affordable. The limits of the system need to be reexamined. The Green Liberals strive for an autonomous demand for services. Discussions about what makes sense should and may also have their place in healthcare - undogmatically, but pietistically. Thanks to efficiency improvements and target group-oriented prevention, costs are to be avoided. The high quality of health care is ensured, for example, with the managed care approach. Environmental protection & nature Protecting natural resources Living sustainably means enjoying, respecting and appreciating nature. Functioning ecosystems and biodiversity are a prerequisite for human survival on this one earth. For us Green Liberals, this means that we always seek a balance between the responsible use of existing resources and the protection of nature. Here, too, our focus is on future generations. Our children and grandchildren have a right to a healthy living space and an intact world. Europe & Bilaterals Networked but independent Switzerland is located in the heart of Europe and is politically, economically and culturally very closely intertwined with the European Union (EU). For the Green Liberals it is clear that Switzerland has to share European responsibility, because Switzerland's prosperity is based on performance and international networking. The bilateral path has proven its worth in the past and is to be further developed. It best accommodates both the desire for networking and for autonomy. However, a common future requires openness to different approaches. Culture Enabling cultural diversity On the one hand, we understand culture as the creative work of creative people. On the other hand, culture is also zeitgeist, a lived, constantly changing understanding of us as inhabitants of Switzerland. Culture is identity-building. Especially in times of globalization and upheaval, the promotion of these identity-forming cultural forms is elementary for us Green Liberals. It therefore needs framework conditions that leave room for creativity. The rights to cultural works should remain with the creator and be preserved."
43120,201510,"Guidelines Now, but also tomorrow We understand politics as a comprehensive means of shaping our social coexistence. In doing so, we are committed to sustainable development, taking equal account of social, economic and environmental objectives. The basis for this is an innovative and sustainably oriented market economy, a vibrant democracy, a careful approach to our environment, and a tolerant society based on solidarity. An intact environment and healthy finances are the basis for maintaining our prosperity. This basis for life must be preserved for future generations through sustainable growth. To ensure that our descendants can also develop freely in their lives, we have a duty to leave them neither ecological nor financial legacies. We want to achieve this primarily with incentives and only where not otherwise possible with regulations and prohibitions. For us, preserving biodiversity is an obligation and an economic necessity. We want to live in a pluralistic society in which individual freedom and personal responsibility enjoy a very high priority. This freedom may only be restricted if the freedom of third parties is curtailed or they are threatened with harm. The state should not dictate to people how they should live and should remain neutral towards all worldviews as long as they are compatible with our legal system. Equality between men and women and all family and life models as well as equal opportunities are a matter of course for us and must be ensured. Discrimination and racism have no place in our society. We stand by the Swiss model of direct democracy and the federalist state , which takes into account our cultural and linguistic diversity. Fundamental rights and international law are binding. Green Liberal policy is fact-oriented. The solution should be valued more highly than party politics in the outdated left-right scheme. In order to achieve our political goals, we rely on an approach based on mutual respect. We make policy for the general public and do not pursue particular interests. We want to play an active role in shaping the future and are convinced that prosperity, progress, an intact environment and a liberal state order can be reconciled. 1. environment, energy, mobility and spatial planning 1.1 Energy and climate Our current energy consumption is not sustainable. We consume more than we can provide from renewable sources. Because unconsumed energy is the most environmentally friendly of all, our top priority is to strive for energy efficiency and the lowest possible energy consumption. We support the rapid introduction of contemporary appliance and technology standards and call for increased efforts in building renovations. Our society will always be dependent on energy as a key resource. To protect the climate and the environment, however, we must change our energy supply: away from CO2-heavy technologies and nuclear power with its unpredictable technical and financial risks, and toward renewable energies. By making this switch, we are not only reducing our environmental impact, but also our dependence on imports of oil, gas and uranium from politically unstable regions where human rights violations often take place. Global climate change is having far-reaching consequences on people, the economy, and the environment, and is intensifying regional and global conflicts over diminishing natural resources. Therefore, efforts to reduce negative human impacts on the climate, especially greenhouse gas emissions, must be rapidly and consistently intensified. At the same time, level-appropriate climate change adaptation measures are important at the global, regional, and local levels. Natural resources must be used more efficiently by closing material cycles, reducing their consumption and avoiding waste. This requires true costs and transparency over the entire life cycle of products, natural resources and forms of energy. We stand by the energy transition and are committed to its implementation. Financial incentives via incentive taxes, bonus-malus systems and adjustments to the tax system can lead us to an ecological, economical and secure energy supply. We therefore focus on cost transparency and an ecological tax reform that replaces existing taxes with an energy tax or a general resource tax in line with the polluter-pays principle and in a state quota-neutral manner. This makes investments in renewable energies from solar, water, wind, geothermal and biomass more attractive. Today, nuclear power in particular is subsidized in a hidden way. The disposal of radioactive waste is unresolved, there is no sufficient insurance in case of damage, and the financial reserves are insufficient for the dismantling and disposal of nuclear power plants after decommissioning. Thanks to greater energy efficiency and a focus on renewable energies, our energy supply will gradually become fully renewable. That's why we don't need new nuclear power plants. The handling of highly radioactive waste from nuclear power plants remains unresolved even after more than 40 years of operation. To date, no long-term storage is possible without residual risk to humans and the environment. Today, we are also technically far away from an ecologically and economically sustainable transmutation, which could make the waste significantly less harmful in the future. All the more, as soon as the amount of high-level radioactive waste is defined by a clear decision to phase it out, the polluters have an obligation to realize the best possible solution for high-level radioactive waste in Switzerland at their own expense, if possible. 1.2 Soil, air, water High-quality soil, air and water form the basis of our health and quality of life. Their preservation requires the sustainable use of our natural resources and, as far as possible, continuous material cycles. Diverse ecosystems are essential for keeping the air and water clean, for soil fertility, and for pollination of crops and wild plants. Too many nutrients and pollutants continue to enter the environment through the improper use of fertilizers and pesticides, as well as contamination from everyday products. This affects soils and water and endangers natural habitats, the preservation of ecosystems and, last but not least, our health. We therefore want to reduce the burden on ecosystems through appropriate market-based incentives. CO2 emissions must be subject to an incentive tax in all areas, including fuels in particular. The limit values for pollutants must be consistently complied with, as must the legal requirements for water protection. We advocate the careful use of water and support the renaturation and revitalization of watercourses. 1.3. mobility Mobility is an important element of our social and economic life. However, the costs caused by this are only insufficiently borne by those who cause them. Mobility is therefore available today at far too low a price, is accordingly in excess demand and has been growing unabated in Switzerland for years. Private motorized transport is one of the largest consumers of fossil resources and one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, pollutants and noise. It must therefore be used moderately and responsibly, and financed in a way that is fair to those who cause it. Accordingly, we are committed to a sustainable transformation of the Swiss transport system: First and foremost, traffic should be avoided, and secondly, the shift to more efficient means of transport such as cycling, walking and public transport should be promoted. To sustainably reduce the need for mobility, we want to bring living, leisure, consumption and work as close together as possible. To achieve this, the costs of mobility must be borne by those who cause them and incentives must be set for thrift and responsible action. Comprehensive mobility pricing is therefore a central element of Green-Liberal transport policy. This is to be implemented in a fiscally and state-quota neutral manner, i.e. overall without imposing any additional burden on the population. In addition to public transport, new environmentally friendly technologies, such as renewable electromobility, can also play a key role in terms of reducing noise and environmental emissions. Furthermore, home office solutions and the increased use of modern means of communication can make an important contribution to reducing work traffic. In the case of air traffic, major and internationally coordinated steps to establish true costs are imperative. Switzerland should work to ensure that air transport is treated in the same way as other modes of transport, particularly in the area of taxation. We are critical of any further expansion of capacity at Swiss airports. We stand by the article on the protection of the Alps in the Federal Constitution and demand the effective and efficient implementation of the shift of transalpine freight traffic to rail. 1.4 Spatial planning We want to preserve the scenic and architectural diversity of Switzerland. This requires a clear separation of settlement and non-settlement areas and a correspondingly adapted spatial development. In the cities, densification on already built-up areas is necessary in order to preserve local recreation areas and green oases in the settlement area and to create new ones. The agglomerations should still be attractive areas with an intact landscape in the future, which requires moderate densification. In peripheral areas, spatial planning must take into account the socioeconomic concerns of mountain and peripheral areas, in addition to protecting landscapes as recreational areas. For example, there should be room for ecologically compatible tourism. The associational right of appeal is important for the enforcement of environmental law. It allows associations to bring omissions to the attention of the authorities and thus ensure compliance with the law. 1.5 Agriculture and forestry Agriculture has a central role to play in sustainable food production and in the conservation of soil and environmental quality, biodiversity and landscape. We are committed to ecologically sustainable, entrepreneurial and multifunctional agriculture with exemplary animal welfare and species-appropriate husbandry of farm animals. This requires a rethinking of agricultural policy. Achieving environmental goals and strengthening entrepreneurship requires less government funding, not more. Environmentally harmful incentives must be eliminated. Instead of flat-rate income support, there is a need for more compensation for sustainable food production methods and for ecological and public services, such as the maintenance of cultivated landscapes or the preservation of biodiversity. We are critical of agriculture with genetically modified organisms. Without a sound scientific basis, we reject agriculture with genetically modified organisms. The forest must be protected as an important habitat for animal and plant species, as a protection against natural hazards and as a recreational area for us humans. As a valuable source of raw materials, our forest should be managed sustainably. The use and processing of domestic wood contributes to reducing the consumption of non-renewable energy, thus protecting the environment and nature. 2. economy, state and finance 2.1 Economic order We see Switzerland's liberal economic system and flexible labor market as a major locational advantage. The state should impose as few barriers as possible on the economy and allow healthy competition to play out in functioning markets. The many thousands of SMEs in Switzerland are an important cornerstone of our economy. Entrepreneurship must be actively promoted with good framework conditions and not unnecessarily restricted by bureaucracy. However, if market failures occur, the state must intervene in a regulatory capacity. This means, for example, that those who cause environmental emissions are not held accountable for them. Government intervention in the market should generally be based on market-based incentive systems such as incentive taxes, and only where not otherwise possible on regulations and prohibitions. We expect companies and business leaders to act ethically and responsibly toward people and the environment at home and abroad. For us, innovation is a key success factor for Switzerland and should be actively supported with incentives and the creation of innovation parks. 2.2 Role of the state We stand for a strong but lean state that focuses on its core tasks, is based on personal responsibility and organizes its services like a modern company. For us, the core tasks of the state include setting the framework for fair and free competition, correcting market failures, protecting individual freedom and security, providing access to education and health, and ensuring the livelihoods of our country's residents who find themselves in dire straits. Regular and careful checks must be made to determine whether tasks are being performed effectively and efficiently by the state or can be carried out better by private parties. 2.3 Financial policy We want the state not to spend more money than it takes in and not to leave our descendants mountains of debt. Because we want to preserve Switzerland's comparatively low public spending ratio, clear priorities must be set when it comes to expenditure. Necessary reorganizations of public budgets must be carried out with targeted waiver plans that address and solve structural problems in a sustainable manner. We welcome a countercyclical fiscal policy, for example within the framework of a debt brake, as the federal government has had for some years. Spending should not grow faster than GDP over the business cycle, so that the state can create a financial cushion in good times and have a stabilizing effect on the economy in a recession. However, we are critical of economic stimulus packages. We want to significantly simplify the tax system and reconcile it with our sustainability goals by means of an ecological tax reform. We support both tax competition between cantons and municipalities and fiscal equalization. Tax competition promotes efficient use of the state's scarce resources and leads to a range of state services that meets needs. At the same time, the equalization of resources and burdens ensures the necessary solidarity between the cantons and regions. We are in favor of effectively combating tax evasion and tax fraud. 2.4 Financial center We are committed to an internationally successful Swiss financial center. Political stability, a good infrastructure and a high level of education are the cornerstones for this. The Swiss financial center should operate exclusively with taxed funds. Financial market policy must aim to secure access to all relevant markets worldwide. To ensure that Switzerland is not put at a market disadvantage, we are committed to efficient international regulatory standards. The Swiss financial center should continue to provide outstanding services in an international comparison. The state should be involved as little as possible in the risks of the financial center. Any risks remaining with the state should be compensated by the financial center. 3. society, education and health 3.1 Culture and sports Culture includes not only art and literature, but also ways of life, basic human rights, value systems, traditions and beliefs. Culture reflects the state of society, promotes the development and transmission of traditions, and is a driver of innovation. We recognize the important identity-forming function of culture as a mediator between different generations, ways of life, languages and regions. Especially in times of globalization and upheaval, it offers orientation and at the same time teaches us to experience the world in a differentiated way. Sport has an integrative effect and connects, overcomes political boundaries and is a link between all population groups. It fulfills an important function in the area of health, but also in integration and social cohesion. We support both targeted promotion of youth and popular sports and good framework conditions for top-level sports. 3.2 Social system The state should promote personal responsibility and solidarity and not take all responsibility away from the responsible individual. In emergency situations, everyone should receive the support they need to live in dignity. Government support must be provided in moderation and according to need. It must be designed to provide the greatest possible incentive to improve income or return to the labor market. We welcome incentives to encourage employers to hire workers who are not fully capable. We stand by the proven three-pillar system of Swiss pension provision, but believe that the timing of retirement should be made more flexible in a gender-neutral way and that the burden should be shared equally between the generations. While the OASI, with its solidarity-based pay-as-you-go system, is designed to redistribute wealth, the pension fund serves as a personal pension plan, with the amount of the pension being based on the total contributions made. In order to keep the state social security system in balance, a debt brake and pensions that can be financed in the long term are needed. 3.3 Life and family models Equality between men and women and between all family and life models is a matter of course for us and must be ensured. This requires, for example, ensuring equal wages for equal work, equal treatment between married couples, registered partnerships and cohabiting couples in tax and social security law, the full opening of marriage to same-sex couples and their admission to adoption proceedings. Raising children should be compatible with a career for both men and women. Offers for day structures and part-time positions are therefore a matter of course for us at all levels and for both genders. The state should not take away the responsibility of raising children from families, but should support them if necessary. 3.4 Education and research Education is of central importance in a liberal society. It enables people to participate in social and economic life in a self-determined manner and to act responsibly. Research is a key driver of progress and essential to meeting the challenges of the future. A strong elementary school, the dual education system, first-class universities and the international recognition of Swiss degrees are of central importance for Switzerland as a research and business location. That is why we are committed to an internationally competitive university and research location. We also support an inter-cantonal coordinated education system and are committed to ensuring that young people can complete an education that matches their abilities. In order to counteract the increasing shortage of skilled workers, training and further education in the relevant specialist areas should be made more attractive for both genders. Despite this high priority given to education, spending in this area must also be critically reviewed on a regular basis. Control mechanisms are designed to ensure quality and the best cost/benefit ratio. We are critical of the trend towards ever stricter criteria and mandatory tertiary qualifications in certain occupational groups. Learning a second national language as a first foreign language in elementary school is of central importance for a multilingual country like Switzerland in order to enable linguistic and cultural exchange between the different parts of the country. 3.5 Health We want a health care system that ensures care for the entire population while promoting personal responsibility and prevention. In principle, we stand by our health insurance system with freedom of choice and competition. However, disincentives must be eliminated. In particular, efficient risk equalization between insurers is necessary and the contractual obligation between insurers and service providers must be questioned. We view the steady growth in healthcare spending with concern. The reasons for this include demographic aging, the growing number of treatment options, the density of physicians in cities, inefficient hospital planning in some cases, and the cost of medications. To get a better handle on health care spending, we need centralization of certain cutting-edge medical treatments. We therefore support an intercantonally coordinated healthcare system. Patients' rights must be strengthened and information about them improved. The discussion of illness and death must be de-tabooed. A living will can reduce questionable and costly life extensions. Conventional medicine and complementary medicine should have a level playing field. In addition, prevention and personal responsibility are to be strengthened. The transmission of the necessary medical data for the benefit of the patients should be guaranteed at all times in compliance with data protection. 3.6 Drug policy In drug policy, we support the proven four-pillar policy consisting of prevention, treatment, harm reduction and repression. The goal must be to prevent individuals from entering addiction, to offer addicts good care and a regular daily routine, and to encourage them to quit whenever possible. At the same time, we want strict prosecution of illegal drug trafficking. However, repression against addicts is not effective. Soft drugs such as cannabis, on the other hand, are to be legalized, taking into account the protection of minors, and taxed in the same way as tobacco and alcohol. 4. foreign policy and migration 4.1 Foreign policy Switzerland is economically, socially and politically one of the most interconnected countries in the world. We see this as an opportunity and are committed to an active policy to promote peace, Democracy, Rule of law, Environmental protection and human rights. As a prosperous country that benefits from globalization, we see Switzerland as having a responsibility to make its contribution to solving global problems. To this end, Switzerland actively participates in international organizations and enters into appropriate partnerships, while respecting its neutrality. Free trade and economic partnerships secure our prosperity and, with the appropriate social and ecological framework conditions, offer all countries an opportunity for economic development. This creates stability, promotes peace and alleviates poverty in the world. In line with our global responsibility, we are committed to sustainable bilateral and multilateral development cooperation that attaches the necessary importance to environmental challenges. In this context, a targeted, efficient and, in particular, transparent use of resources is urgently needed. A coherent development policy also includes the renunciation of export subsidies and access to the Swiss market for developing countries. 4.2 Europe Switzerland is geographically and culturally part of Europe. Politically and economically, it is strongly linked to the EU. Good cooperation is therefore in our very own interest, which is why we stand by the bilateral path and its further development. We recognize the achievements of the EU for peace and prosperity on the European continent. We want to steadily develop the bilateral path with the EU and extend it to new states. If this is no longer possible, we are open to alternatives. 4.3 Migration and asylum policy We are convinced that our economy and society have benefited from migration in the past decades and will continue to benefit in the future, and likewise that access to foreign labor markets is an enrichment for many Swiss people. If people want to settle in our country, their will to integrate is a prerequisite. In principle, the principle of personal responsibility also applies here. However, the state should support integration, for example with offers such as language courses. After successful integration, migrants should have the opportunity to obtain Swiss citizenship. The granting of citizenship must be based primarily on the degree of integration, especially language skills, and should not be based purely on the length of residence in Switzerland or fail due to excessive administrative requirements. We stand by Switzerland's humanitarian tradition. Our country should continue to offer security to persecuted people. To ensure that this remains the case, asylum procedures must be carried out quickly and abuses must be combated consistently. 5. security policy 5.1 Internal security Fundamental rights such as personal freedom and integrity as well as the property of every human being must be protected. Where personal responsibility and decency fail, the state has the task of protecting these fundamental rights and punishing offenders consistently. However, we must be aware that there can be no absolute security in a free society. State protection measures require a legal basis and effective political control. People who abide by our laws should be trusted and privacy guaranteed. 5.2 Army We recognize the need for national defense in the form of a lean and cost-efficient militia army. However, the mission and the design of the armed forces must be adapted to the most high-risk threats and dangers today and in the future. These include cyber risks and terrorism, the protection of critical infrastructures and subsidiary missions such as support services for the cantons in the event of environmental disasters. The Swiss Armed Forces' mission also includes peacekeeping operations under a UN mandate in conflicts abroad. With respect to the Air Force, air policing is a priority. Furthermore, we are in favor of a general compulsory service instead of the current compulsory military service, in which women and men are free to choose in peacetime in which area (civil defense, civilian service or military) they would like to serve. We advocate service models that make it as easy as possible to combine compulsory service with education, career and family."
43120,201910,"It's time - 26 Green-Liberal policy positions Pioneer in climate protection Switzerland must live up to the Paris climate agreement. And do it quickly and consistently. To achieve this, we need an ambitious CO2 reduction target at home and quality assurance for offsetting abroad. But above all, effective measures are needed. In addition to buildings, finally also in road and air traffic. This ecological turnaround is possible. And if we implement it properly, it will be a great opportunity for our economy. We want to play a pioneering role internationally in climate protection and clean technologies. Cleantech Location No. 1 The link between the environment and the economy is the original idea of the Green Liberals. Consistent climate protection and the energy strategy are great opportunities for our economy. The consistent and rapid transition from promoting to directing will make subsidies and many regulations superfluous. A user-pays energy price improves the profitability of energy efficiency measures and ensures the implementation of cleantech solutions that have long been available. This creates a huge export industry in our country. Protect livelihoods Biodiversity and water quality in Switzerland are under threat. In fact, today we are subsidizing the pollution of drinking water and soil. Insects and birds die. These misaligned incentives in agriculture must finally be eliminated, especially in the case of overfertilization and the excessive use of pesticides. The federal government should not continue to encourage this, but should exclude the use of high-risk pesticides from direct payment eligibility. In addition, a binding reduction target for nitrogen emissions is needed. Europe as an opportunity We want to protect and strengthen the common values of Switzerland and its European partners, such as human rights and democracy. We want to be able to participate equally in economic life and acquire education throughout Europe. And we want goods and services to be able to move and trade freely within Europe without hurdles. The way to get there is through a framework agreement. That is why almost all companies, universities and business associations support this far-reaching development of the bilateral agreements. Fair individual taxation Switzerland's labor force potential is far from being exhausted. Many well-educated people work less than they would like to. The disproportionately high tax burden on second earnings eats away a large part of the additional income. This exacerbates the shortage of skilled workers. The solution is individual taxation. Cleverly designed, this can improve the incentives for second earners to work, increase the labor force participation of women, and thus contribute to prosperity in Switzerland. Marriage for all A segment of society continues to be denied the rights of civil marriage. The registered partnership is still only a second-class marriage available to them. This is unworthy of a modern constitutional state and no longer in keeping with the times. The implementation of our Marriage for All initiative is a long overdue step towards eliminating discrimination against same-sex couples and creating equal rights and responsibilities for all. That is a liberal matter of course. Enable innovation Laws are regularly passed in parliament that do not serve the national economy as a whole, but rather the interests of individual industries or companies. Examples are the ""Lex Booking.com"" or the anti-competitive Telecommunications Act, which privileges the majority state-owned Swisscom. The sharing economy is also being fought on various levels. We want to counter this protectionism. Digitization and competition must finally be recognized as an opportunity by policymakers. Efficient public service More and more state-owned companies are moving into private markets. Be it Swiss Post, Ruag or Swisscom or cantonal energy suppliers, IT companies or building insurers. This development is problematic in terms of competition policy. Because it is not a competition with equal long spears. The state-owned corporations have enormous market power thanks to the monopoly sector. The state-owned companies should refocus on the actual public service. This allows innovative private companies to develop optimally. Intelligence instead of concrete The federal government continues to spend billions on its infrastructures. The response to increases in traffic demand is still the same: expansion. The money goes into asphalt and concrete. Yet our roads already have massive overcapacity outside of peak times. Intelligent traffic management systems, modern work and school models, and mobility pricing can solve this problem. This would save us a lot of money, have less impact on the environment and, first of all, increase everyone's comfort. Every building a power plant We want to create the framework conditions for a more efficient and decentralized power supply. We want smart grids instead of a copper battle. The technologies have been available for years, but utilities and policymakers are in a deep sleep. Digitalization in particular is enabling new dimensions in the way we deal with energy, especially in energy efficiency and decentralized energy production. Practically every building or neighborhood is suitable and should be supplied with as much self-generated energy as possible. Sustainable mobility To sustainably reduce the need for mobility, we want to bring living, leisure and work as close together as possible. Intelligent land use planning and comprehensive mobility pricing is a key element of our policy. The main aim is to avoid traffic, but also to encourage a shift to more efficient modes of transport such as cycling, walking and public transport. Electromobility has a key role to play, precisely because the secondary use of batteries as building or neighborhood storage ideally complements our future electricity system. Densification instead of urban sprawl Densification on already built-up areas is necessary in order to preserve local recreation areas and green oases in the settlement area and to create new ones. The agglomerations should continue to be attractive areas with an intact landscape in the future, which requires moderate densification. In peripheral areas, in addition to protecting landscapes as recreational areas, land use planning must take into account the social and economic concerns of mountain and peripheral areas. An ecologically compatible tourism should have place. Contemporary agriculture We stand for ecologically sustainable, entrepreneurial and multifunctional agriculture. For this to happen, policymakers need to rethink. Strengthening entrepreneurship and innovation and improving the quality of the environment requires less, not more, funding from the state. Incentives that are harmful to the environment must be removed. Community and ecological services, such as the maintenance of the cultural landscape and the preservation of biodiversity, are to be increasingly compensated. Liberal economic order We see Switzerland's liberal economic system and flexible labor market as a major locational advantage. Entrepreneurship must be actively promoted with good framework conditions and not unnecessarily restricted by bureaucracy. The many thousands of SMEs in Switzerland are an important cornerstone of our economy. State intervention in the market should generally take place with market-based incentive systems such as incentive taxes and only where not otherwise possible through regulations and bans. Healthy finances We want the state not to leave mountains of debt to our descendants. Clear priorities must be set when it comes to spending. We support both fair tax competition between cantons and municipalities and fiscal equalization. Tax competition promotes the efficient use of the state's scarce resources and leads to the provision of state services that meet the needs of the population. At the same time, the equalization of resources and burdens ensures the necessary solidarity between the cantons and regions. Fair social policy We stand by a social safety net that enables a dignified life in all life situations. However, social policy will only do justice to people if it is geared to their potential. This means, for example, that social assistance must also show ways back to an independent life. Moreover, social policy is only sustainable if it secures our social services for future generations. We therefore reject the indiscriminate watering-can policy from the left just as much as austerity exercises with the lawnmower from the right. Retirement provision suitable for grandchildren Fortunately, we are getting older and older. This leads to a need for reform in the area of old-age provision. We want to make the timing of retirement more flexible and equalize the retirement age for the sexes. At the same time, there needs to be an improvement for part-time income in the second pillar by eliminating the coordination deduction. The burdens are to be distributed evenly among the generations. To ensure this intergenerational equity, a debt brake for old-age provision is a necessity. Liberal society We want to live in a society that places a very high value on individual freedom and personal responsibility. The state should not dictate to people how they should live and should remain neutral towards all world views as long as they are compatible with our legal system. Equality of opportunity, gender equality and all family and life models are a matter of course for us and must be ensured. Discrimination and racism have no place in our society. 100% equality Equality of the sexes and of all family and life models is a matter of course for us. This includes ensuring equal wages for equal work and equal treatment in tax and social security law. The opening of marriage to same-sex couples and full equality in adoption and reproductive medicine are urgent. In addition, the compatibility of work and family life must be ensured by offering day structures at all levels. Strengthen education & research Education and research play a key role in a liberal society. In particular, to ensure equal opportunities and our innovative strength. A strong elementary school and the dual education system are of central importance. The learning of a second national language as a first foreign language in elementary school is important to enable linguistic and cultural exchange between the different parts of the country. We also actively promote an internationally competitive higher education system. and research location Switzerland. Reform health care We want a health care system that ensures care for the entire population and at the same time promotes personal responsibility and prevention in order to reduce costs. We stand by our health insurance system with freedom of choice and competition. However, false incentives must be eliminated. Among other things, this requires uniform financing of inpatient and outpatient services. Volume-based pay incentives for hospitalists should be eliminated. Patients' rights must be strengthened and information about them improved. Open and networked Switzerland Switzerland is one of the most networked countries in the world. We see this as an opportunity and are committed to an active policy to promote peace, Democracy, Rule of law, Environmental protection and human rights. Free trade and economic partnerships secure our prosperity and, with the appropriate social and ecological framework conditions, offer all countries an opportunity for economic development. This creates stability, promotes peace and alleviates poverty in the world. Successful integration We believe that our economy and society benefit from migration and will continue to benefit in the future. When people settle in our country, their will to integrate is a prerequisite. The principle of personal responsibility also applies here. However, the state should support integration, for example with language courses. The granting of citizenship must be based primarily on the degree of integration and should not be based purely on the length of residence in Switzerland. Preserve humanitarian tradition We stand by Switzerland's humanitarian tradition. Our country should continue to offer security to persecuted people in the future. To ensure that this remains the case, asylum procedures must be carried out quickly. In line with our global responsibility, we are committed to sustainable development cooperation that attaches the necessary importance to ecological challenges. A coherent development policy also includes the renunciation of export subsidies and access to the Swiss market for developing countries. Protect fundamental rights Fundamental rights such as personal freedom and integrity as well as the property of every person must be protected. Where personal responsibility and decency fail, the state has the task of protecting these basic rights and consistently punishing offenses. However, we must be aware that there can be no absolute security in a free society. State protection measures require a legal basis and effective control. In our free society, trust should be given and privacy should be guaranteed. Service instead of compulsory military service The Army must be adapted to the most risky threats and dangers today and in the future. These include cyber risks and terrorism, the protection of critical infrastructure, support services in the event of environmental disasters and peacekeeping missions as part of a UN mandate. We also call for a general compulsory service instead of the current compulsory military service, in which women and men are free to choose in peacetime in which area (civil defense, civilian service or military) they would like to serve."
43320,199910,"Foreword The federal elections of October 24 could move Switzerland politically more than any election in recent decades: The majority of Swiss who want to live in an open and social Switzerland are threatened not only by a preemption of right-wing nationalist and populist forces, but also by a shrinking of the political center and, going hand in hand with that, a government dominated by Blocher's SVP. The result would be disastrous: an isolated, socially divided Switzerland - a rich, right-wing nationalist island in the middle of Europe. For this not to happen, two conditions must be met: The SP must win the elections. But that is not enough: - Together with the constructive forces of the political center, we must create a climate in Switzerland in which it is no longer possible (that) a few tens of thousands of refugees become the only relevant topic of the outgoing century in the public perception. We need a majority in Parliament and in the government that is in favor of EU accession; - a sustainable economic policy and the corresponding creation of secure jobs - a social security network that meets the basic needs of all; - a society where women are no longer disadvantaged in employment, social security, politics and many other areas; - a modern education system geared towards future needs; - a healthcare system whose costs are better controlled and more fairly distributed; - a policy that also meets the ideal of a social and cosmopolitan Switzerland in all other areas. This election platform shows how we want to get closer to our political goals in the next four years: In parliament, with the strongest possible representation - but also as a political movement that has ideals, lives by them and tries to implement them. Ursula Koch, President of the SP Switzerland 1. with sustainable growth, gainful employment for all Job losses and unemployment, falling real wages, poorer working conditions and the growing income gap are pressing problems for a majority of people in our country today. Switzerland needs a massive reduction in working hours, a redistribution of paid and unpaid work, and a fairer - and thus more business-friendly - distribution of income and wealth, including between men and women. Switzerland can and must afford gainful employment for all while real wages continue to rise. The prerequisite for this is an economic policy that strengthens household demand and focuses on socially and environmentally compatible and thus sustainable growth. The demands of the SP: 1. full employment should prevail in Switzerland. Along the way, the number of registered unemployed will be at least halved by 2003 with a binding employment target, as will the number of job seekers. 2 The state will promote the necessary growth through its own investment activities. It ensures that more investment capital is created instead of speculative capital. With its own investments, the state ensures a high-quality, nationwide supply of services in the areas of rail, postal services, finance and telecommunications. Innovations must be promoted until they are ready for the market. 3 Additional gainful employment must be permanent: The coming economic upswing must therefore be designed to be sustainable. Ecological tax reform plays a central role. 4. 4. the economic position of employees must be strengthened with higher real wages and profit-sharing and corresponding co-participation. This applies primarily to lower and middle incomes and helps to stop the redistribution from the bottom to the top, increase domestic demand and thus secure jobs. In order to achieve this, the Social Democratic Party calls for the introduction of a statutory minimum wage of Fr. 3,000 per month. The economic upswing alone does not guarantee additional gainful employment, but it is an indispensable prerequisite for it. The increase in demand necessary for this can only be achieved with more effective protection against the deterioration of wage and working conditions. This includes the following measures: -minimum wages and other effective measures against wage dumping, -Only companies that pay wages in line with local and professional standards are admitted to public tenders, -Equal pay for women must be enforced, Part-time work must no longer be discriminated against in terms of social insurance. 6. not only does Switzerland need more adequately paid employment, the available gainful employment must also be distributed more fairly. The federal administration and companies belonging to the federal government must set a good example. At the same time, corresponding efforts in the private industrial and service sectors must be promoted. 7. 7. if the Confederation takes measures to create or maintain jobs, it shall ensure an appropriate regional distribution. It gives preference to mountain regions and areas with special economic problems are given preferential treatment. 8. Swiss antitrust law is tightened and adapted to that of the EU. Switzerland finally needs a ban on cartels. In the future, it must also be possible to impose fines for violations of the law in the past, for example in cases such as the price cartel in which the Roche Group was demonstrably involved. 9. undeclared work will be combated with economic incentives and unbureaucratic control mechanisms. 10. the federal government takes on a leading and impulse function in improving the qualifications of all employed and unemployed persons. A special role is played by a quantitatively sufficient and high-quality supply of apprenticeships, as called for in the apprenticeship initiative of the SP and trade unions. 2 The ecological transformation is an opportunity for the environment and for Switzerland as a workplace: let's take advantage of it! Growing social problems and high unemployment, together with social cuts, have tended to marginalize environmental concerns. For those who are oriented toward short-term returns, there is a contradiction between economic and environmental interests. What we want is an economy at the service of people, not people at the service of the economy. In this context, the ecological restructuring of the economy offers the opportunity to create additional jobs within the framework of an innovative and growth-oriented economic policy and , at the same time, to make an important contribution to the careful use of scarce resources. For the SP, it is therefore clear that the ecological restructuring of our economy must begin immediately! The demands of the SP: 1. Switzerland reforms its tax system according to ecological principles (ecological tax reform). Energy consumption is taxed, which creates an incentive to use energy sparingly and efficiently. 2. the energy levy decision (EAB) - created under the pressure of the solar initiative must be consistently designed and enforced. The levies on non-renewable energies (nuclear power, fossil fuels) generate CHF 800 million annually, which are used as an investment bonus for renewable energies, for rational and intelligent energy use and for the renewal of hydropower. In this way, we will achieve - the creation of 30,000 jobs, - the nationwide spread of future-proof technologies (technology effect), - the opening up of new occupational fields (qualification effect), - the more efficient use of energy (sustainability effect) For the SP, the implementation of the EAB is a prerequisite for the approval of the liberalization of the electricity market. 3 Switzerland is phasing out nuclear power as quickly as possible and is pushing ahead with replacement by renewable energies and rational energy use (e.g. systematic promotion of the Minergie standard). The energy levy resolution is needed to finance these measures. Consumption of non-renewable energy sources will be halved in the long term. A new constitutional provision opens the door to an ecological tax reform . 4 Switzerland implements a sustainable transport policy. This requires the following measures: - the financing of public transport, especially regional transport, through fuel duty revenues (adjustment of the corresponding earmarking), - a rail innovation program and favorable offers in rail transport to bring detour heavy traffic onto the rails, - the reduction of energy consumption and emissions in private transport. 5. Switzerland needs a nationwide coordination to avoid unnecessary sources of electrosmog (e.g. mobile phone antennas). The burden of proof of non-hazardousness must be on the operators. 3. fiscal and tax policy in the service of full employment and justice In the 1990s, under the pretext of globalization and recession, the bourgeoisie began with growing aggressiveness to question basic state functions and redistributive functions. More and more brazenly, they defend the tax privileges of the rich and even demand new ones. The SP, on the other hand, values a functioning state that continues to fully guarantee social security and public services and that finances itself as fairly as possible. Without falling into the trap of bourgeois austerity hysteria, it is therefore also committed to restoring the federal finances and limiting the debt ratio. Such efforts must be expenditure- and revenue-driven and must not slow down the economy, because a growing economy is the best means for healthy finances. The demands of the SP: 1. the Confederation makes savings where it is possible without major problems and where it also makes sense: in product-linked subsidies and market support for conventional agriculture, in road construction, in civil defense and, of course, in national defense. The halving of national defense spending alone, as called for by the SP, will bring about a reduction of around CHF 1.8 billion, of which around CHF 600 million should be used directly as savings potential. 2 Instead of even more tax giveaways for the richest in our country, Switzerland finally needs effective measures against tax loopholes. Priority for the SP is the introduction of a capital gains tax for private individuals, the elimination of the various tax privileges for high incomes and assets in the area of voluntary social security, and the abolition of the debt interest deduction and imputed rental value. 3. 3. people with high incomes must also be made to pay more for the financing of the health care system. If VAT is increased (adjustment to Europe), the additional funds must be used to finance social welfare, not to reduce (or abolish) direct taxes. These remain the central redistribution instrument from the richer to the poorer. 4 The VAT rate will be differentiated, as in many European countries. Luxury goods are to be charged at a higher special rate, while goods and services for everyday use are to be relieved. 5. (5) The SNB's monetary policy shall primarily support employment and growth policies and ensure long-term monetary stability. In this sense, it is oriented to the overall economic benefit. In particular, it ensures lower real interest rates. It increases the profit contributions to the Confederation and the cantons due to better management of its assets. 6. tax harmonization reduces the differences in the tax burden between the cantons! The proposals for a new fiscal equalization system (NFA) cannot replace substantive tax harmonization, even if the proposed equalization of resources and burdens would bring welcome improvements. However, the balancing effect remains too weak. 7. to promote renewable energies and to create sustainable jobs, taxes should be levied on non-renewable energy sources. 4. public service: high quality for all instead of even more privatization In a democratic state, basic services must be offered nationwide and at low cost so that they are accessible to all. This requires a good state infrastructure with exemplary working conditions and motivated personnel. In addition to education and training, these services include railroads, postal services, telecommunications, electricity and also the media. Experience in other countries shows that privatization creates new problems and replaces the state monopoly with private ones, but now outside public control. In many cases, liberalization means centralization and job cuts. This hits the peripheral regions particularly hard. The newly won entrepreneurial freedom must not lead to companies neglecting their responsibility as employers! Productivity increases in federally controlled companies must generally be passed on to employees in the form of reductions in working hours in order to prevent further job cuts. At the same time, new working time models are needed, which must be negotiated with the trade unions. The demands of the SP: 1st Postal Service: The federal government may not hawk the Post. To enable it to hold its own against private competition, it will retain a monopoly for letters and light parcels in the future. The dense network of post offices must not be cut back. It must not be the goal of Swiss Post to increase its profits through ruthless staff reductions. Swiss Post, on the other hand, must become even more attractive, e.g. with new financial services. 2 Telecommunications / Swisscom: The majority of Swisscom must remain in the hands of the federal government. Its new entrepreneurial freedom gives it the opportunity to maintain and expand its strong market position. The following points must be given special attention in further development: - The peripheral regions also benefit from offers that go beyond the basic service; - All companies active in this sector ensure a regional distribution of jobs and sufficient apprenticeships; - The federal government ensures effective measures for the transparency of prices and service offers. 3. SBB/Railways: More passengers and goods on the rails! No easy task for the railroad. It must become more productive and innovative in competing with the road in order to maintain its market share. At the same time, the wrong course must be avoided: Major rail projects (e.g. the Neat) must not be realized at the expense of regional transport, the pursuit of financial success must not push transport policy objectives into the background, and the quality of service must also be maintained in the regions. The bilateral treaties with the EU on land transport will bring the gradual admission of 40-ton trucks and thus an increase in road productivity. In order to achieve the shift of heavy goods traffic to the railroads required by the constitution, the accompanying measures demanded by the SP are needed. 4. electricity market: The SP Switzerland is fundamentally opposed to the principle of liberalizing the electricity market. If the electricity market has to be liberalized, then it should certainly be done gradually and certainly not at a higher cadence than our European neighbors. In particular, the interests of employees should be and the environment. At the very least, however, the design of the electricity market must meet the following conditions: - equivalent conditions throughout the country; - state monopoly on important infrastructure elements to secure supply and maintain the public service; - basic supply for consumers without free market access; - strengthening of competition control; 5. Public media: The position of the SRG must not be weakened, e.g. by distributing fees also to private providers, because only it fulfills a performance mandate with comparatively high - and to be further maintained - quality. In return, it ensures that the quality of its broadcasts is enhanced and expands its offering in the information sector. In line with its mandate, it promotes the diversity of cultures, languages and opinions in our country. 6 New Federal Personnel Act: Reform must not mean deregulation of the public labor market! Despite adaptation to the new framework conditions, the conditions of employment under public law must remain exemplary and future-oriented. They guarantee: -employment security; - prohibition of dismissals for economic reasons; - uniform principles for working hours, rest day, vacations and vacations; - renunciation of regional wages; - maximum and minimum wages for all fields of activity. - In federal enterprises, both the pressure on the wages of employees (especially young ones) and the exaggerated top salaries for managers must not be accepted. Deviations from these uniform principles may only be permitted in exceptional cases where collective labor agreements under public law are agreed between the social partners. 5 Education is the future - Switzerland must invest in the future! The importance of science and education for the economy and society is growing rapidly. Science and research are internationalizing. Democratic and free access to education is a prerequisite for the realization of equal opportunities. Especially in the information society, education, training and continuing education are decisive for the life and career prospects of each and every individual and for participation in society. Although most civic leaders also talk about ""investing in the future,"" they are not willing to provide more funding today. This means that Switzerland is losing momentum - albeit at a high level - even compared with other industrialized countries, which have been investing massively more for several years. This can lead to development problems in the area of future technologies and for the range of corresponding occupational fields. The demands of the SP: 1. the public sector provides more financial resources for education and science for the current and upcoming reforms (vocational training, continuing education, universities of applied sciences, universities) so that these reforms also succeed. This also includes the promotion of educational research. 2. the role of the federal government in education and science policy must be redefined and its regulatory influence strengthened. To this end, the necessary constitutional foundations must be created (education article). 3. 3) Special support programs for girls and women are needed to broaden access to the ""male domains"" at all levels of the educational and professional system. 4. the introduction of early language teaching with options throughout Switzerland. 5 The information society and the new information and communication technologies place new demands on education, training and further education on the one hand, and on the other hand they themselves provide new instruments for the imparting of education. The federal government and the cantons must - in a coordinated manner - quickly launch comprehensive programs (""Learning in the Information Society"") which, among other things, a) teach the new qualifications; b) train the teaching staff; c) strive for optimal pedagogical-didactic implementation and d) provide the necessary infrastructure. 6) In order to promote a sufficient supply of apprenticeships, especially for the professions of the future, and to prevent free-riding, all employers should contribute financially to a vocational training fund, as demanded by the apprenticeship initiative supported by the SP. 7. the vocational baccalaureate becomes more attractive. This requires better framework conditions such as more vacations, enough time for school or in-service training courses for adults. 8. Offers for catch-up education and continuing education are given more weight. There is a need for an actual continuing education offensive. 9. special integration programs must be created for the scholastically weak, the disabled and people with language difficulties, especially for young people. 10. in the course of the ongoing reform of the universities of applied sciences, universities of applied sciences and technical college courses may only be recognized if there is no labeling fraud. The universities of applied sciences under cantonal jurisdiction (e.g. social work, health professions), in which women in particular are strongly represented, will be fully integrated into the Swiss university of applied sciences landscape. 11. the Confederation and the cantons must increase their efforts in favor of the ""Swiss University"", the integration of ETH, universities and universities of applied sciences in a network based on the division of labor and permeability with regionally distributed competence centers and without discriminating against small universities. 12. there is a backlog in the development of future technologies. Risk research and technology assessment must also be strengthened. At the same time, the ""soft"" humanities and social sciences must be upgraded relative to the hard ones. 13. the proportion of women must be massively increased in the scientific community, especially among the teaching staff. What is also needed in particular is better and more targeted support for young talent. 6. bilateral treaties and EU accession with internal reforms The SP wants Switzerland to join the EU as quickly as possible. This is the only possible logical step in order to be present with full voting rights in the decisions that are also relevant for Switzerland, to provide a political response to economic globalization and to become a fully-fledged player in the construction of Europe's security and peace policy architecture. On the doorstep today are the Bilateral Agreements, which would improve Switzerland's ability to cope with Europe and the starting position of the economy in particular. As in the case of EU accession, the SP wants to use the given domestic policy leeway to shape the integration steps - where this is at all necessary - in a socially and environmentally compatible manner. Accompanying measures in the areas of land transportation and the free movement of persons are therefore a mandatory prerequisite for approval of the treaties. 1. the SP would welcome the conclusion of the Bilateral Agreements because they could solve some pressing problems. 2 The SP links its approval of the bilateral agreements to three euro-compatible conditions and accompanying measures: - Free movement of persons: In contrast to some members of the bourgeoisie and employers who want to abuse the free movement of persons to worsen working conditions, the SP and the trade unions are calling for three effective main measures: a) the facilitated declaration of general applicability of collective employment contracts, b) the possibility of setting minimum wages in the cantons and c) a Posted Workers Act that prescribes the working conditions applicable in Switzerland for posted foreign workers. - Land transportation: Binding, annually reviewed modal shift targets are needed to shift heavy road traffic to rail. The financial resources for subsidizing rail freight transport must be targeted and linked to the conditions of additional transport services provided by the railroads. Furthermore, there is a need for more efficient control of weight, speed and working time regulations in road freight transport. 40-tonne quotas for Swiss hauliers must be linked to rail transport. - Linkage: The agreements must be legally or politically linked to the accompanying measures. 3. Since the Bilateral Agreements do not change anything in Switzerland's fundamental foreign policy isolation, accession negotiations with the EU must be started immediately after the conclusion of the corresponding political process. Direct accession should be sought if the accompanying measures to the bilateral treaties are not sufficient. 4. 4 In this sense, the SP supports the popular initiative ""Yes to Europe"". 5. once Switzerland is a member of the EU, the SP will campaign there for a social, ecological and democratic Europe. 7. social cohesion requires strong social insurance systems Falling real wages, an increasing number of unemployed and a shockingly high poverty rate made it clear in the 1990s that there were still serious gaps in the social security network. The gap between rich and poor has widened further and reached intolerable proportions. Switzerland therefore needs a sensible expansion of its social welfare systems. In order to ensure the financial security of the social security system, and in particular of the AHV despite demographic developments, the first thing that is needed is more people in work and higher real wages. In addition, new sources of financing must be tapped: e.g. additional VAT percentages, a federal inheritance tax or the capital gains tax. The demands of the SP 1. we need flexible solutions for the retirement age of women and men. The retirement age must be adapted to people and the reality of work. Within the framework of the 11th AHV revision, a socially acceptable solution must be found that makes it financially possible for all employees to retire at the age of 60. 2) In health insurance, the unsocial per capita premiums are to be replaced by a form of financing that is geared to the income and wealth of the insured. 3. cuts in unemployment insurance are not an issue for the SP. The (re)integration of all population groups into the labor market is an urgent task. In addition, older unemployed persons must be examined for their eligibility for supplementary benefits. 4. part-time and flexible work will be better protected. There are still serious insurance gaps in accident insurance and pension funds, which put women in particular at a disadvantage. In the 2nd pillar, the coordinated salary must be reduced so that small and medium incomes are also well insured. When calculating pensions, women's work and life patterns must be taken into account so that they, too, can freely choose the time of their retirement from working life. 5. the economic situation of families can be significantly improved by restructuring the existing, antisocial system of child allowances and tax deductions. The SP proposes a living wage for children and a supplementary benefit for parents. 6. The Confederation shall ensure that the costs incurred by the municipalities and cantons for unemployed persons who have lost their jobs are balanced. Reducing military spending, as demanded by the popular initiative ""Save on the Armed Forces and Overall Defense,"" will free up 1.8 billion Swiss francs annually, one third of which is to be used for social security. 8. health must be affordable for all The Swiss healthcare system is currently suffering from two problems: the capitation system, which is unique in Europe and thanks to which Christoph Blocher pays around 4,000 times less in premiums for basic insurance in relation to his income than a family with an income of 50,000 Swiss francs. Volume expansions that cannot be justified on the grounds of health necessity and that lead to sharp cost increases in the area of outpatient medicine, for example. Switzerland is about to set a new course in healthcare policy: We have the choice between a free-market two-tier medical system along the lines of the United States and a model that is socially financed (and therefore also euro-compatible) and exploits potential savings in order to guarantee all insured persons a comprehensive range of basic services. For the SP, one thing is clear: Switzerland can and must afford a high-quality healthcare system that remains financially accessible to all. The demands of the SP: 1. the unsocial per capita premiums must be abolished. As envisaged in our ""Health must remain affordable"" initiative, half of the health insurance funds must be financed with an addition to the value-added tax, and half with income- and wealth-related premiums. This would provide financial relief for more than 80 percent of the insured. Until the unsocial capitation premiums are abolished, a more effective premium reduction system that reduces the financial burden is needed for small and medium incomes and especially for families. This means: the cantons have to exhaust the federal subsidies, the premium reduction has to happen automatically, all bureaucratic hurdles have to disappear. 2. the cost explosion in the health care system should be controlled: today, costs are no longer increasing in hospitals, but in the outpatient part of care. The cantons should therefore be given the authority to introduce global budgets in this sector, so that on the one hand costs can be controlled, and on the other hand patients continue to receive the services they need (also in the field of alternative medicine). 3. 3. strict quality control in the health care system should eliminate unnecessary services (it is estimated that up to ¼ of all services). Thanks to this rationalization of the system, any rationing discourse will become obsolete. 4. 4. the federal government should finally be given the authority to plan cutting-edge medicine in such a way that expensive duplication is avoided. 5. the new physician tariffs, which primarily favor family physicians and physicians who take time for their patients, should be put into effect as soon as possible. This will also limit the income of chief physicians and specialty physicians. 6. drug prices should not be higher than in neighboring countries. 7. a more cost-effective, yet high-quality health care system requires expansion and better coordination in the area of prevention. 8. the financing of nursing homes should finally be regulated: Health insurance companies and cantons should no longer be able to squeeze each other for their financing, so that older people often become victims of this struggle. Here, too, we demand clear regulations. 9 Spitex services must be expanded so that the elimination of acute beds is possible and so that as many people as possible can be treated at home. As with the financing of public hospitals, the cantons will in future also have to assume half of the costs for services provided by non-profit Spitex organizations. 9. equality must be implemented Despite legal equality and legislation to promote equality, many women continue to suffer direct and indirect discrimination in many areas of life. In the world of work, women are the first victims of restructuring, receiving lower wages for work of equal value, occupying lower-skilled and lower-paid jobs on average, and accumulating family responsibilities and professional activities. The education system entrenches inequalities. Women remain massively underrepresented in politics and administration. Conversely, the socially necessary care and education work in the area of the family, which is essentially performed by women, is still classified as secondary in social and economic terms. Putting equality into practice requires changing social, economic and cultural structures. The demands of the SP: 1. for education to become the pillar of equality, it needs: - A far-reaching reform of the education system designed to promote equality. - Active measures to improve women's access to technical and generally ""male"" professions, especially in promising sectors such as IT, telematics, medical technology, administration and law, etc. - Concrete measures for the advancement of women and, in particular, the introduction of quotas in research and academic careers. - A policy of continuing education and training that takes into account the specific needs of women. 2. for the redistribution of paid and unpaid work: - The strict implementation of the new Equality Law, namely with the strengthening of the Equality Offices in the different branches of the administration. - Specific policies for the integration and reintegration of women into the labor market. - A significant reduction in working hours and a fair distribution of paid and unpaid work. - The consideration of specifically female qualifications in the calculation of wages. 3. For a better distribution of responsibilities in politics and administration, there is a need for: -Concrete measures, e.g. the introduction of quotas (quota initiative), a fair representation of women at all political levels. -The promotion of women's access to management positions in public administration. -Specific working conditions, e.g. adjusted working hours to facilitate the combination of professional activities with family duties and political activities. 4. in order to distribute duties and responsibilities in the family more equitably, there is a need for: -Tax and financial measures in favor of families, as listed in the Family Policy chapter of this platform. -Concrete measures to better reconcile child-rearing and care responsibilities with professional activities, such as the introduction of parental leave, the introduction of family-friendly school schedules, the expansion of childcare services, etc. 5. to prevent violence against women: -a promotion of the rights of women who separate from their violent husbands (including the introduction of a right to stay) for victims of spousal violence; -a regulation of the ""trafficking"" of women and nightclub dancers; -better enforcement of the provisions that criminalize the commission of sexual offenses against minors abroad. 10. equal rights: reducing discrimination The new Federal Constitution prohibits discrimination against people on the basis of origin, race, gender, age, language, social status, lifestyle, religious, ideological or political convictions, or because of a physical, mental or psychological disability. This far-reaching constitutional protection must be implemented through legislative measures. The SP intensifies its fight for integration and equality of population groups that are disadvantaged and discriminated against or whose claims are only realized on paper: Women, foreigners, the unemployed, young people (...). Concrete demands can be found in this election platform in the corresponding chapters. In addition, measures to eliminate disadvantages for the disabled, as required by the new constitutional article, are particularly noteworthy. This must also be concretized with regard to the rights of gays and lesbians. The demands of the SP 1. people with disabilities need the protection and solidarity of the whole society. The law implementing the constitutional article promotes their integration and self-determination and opens the way for them to participate in society. Structural obstacles are removed as far as possible, the use of public facilities is guaranteed. The occupational integration of disabled persons is promoted by reintegration measures; this goal is also served by a better graduation of disability pensions. Integration in education must also be massively strengthened. The work of the associations that strive for the social integration of the disabled continues to be supported by the state. Our society is characterized by a variety of different forms of cohabitation: Marriage and family, single parenthood, cohabitation, concubinage, same-sex partnership. Marriage and family are given preferential treatment by the state and its institutions, while other forms of cohabitation suffer from various disadvantages (inheritance law, social security law, visitation rights, obligations to provide information in health care, adoption, right to refuse to testify, residence rights of foreign partners). Discrimination in this area must be eliminated. 11. integrate youth in decision-making processes A modern society depends on the integration of all generations. The future of the welfare state, for example, can only be guaranteed with an alliance between the generations, an alliance that goes beyond the representation of the different age groups in politics. The SP Switzerland strives for a society in which young and old actively participate together in all areas of society. The dialogue between the generations must be promoted. To achieve this goal, young people must be integrated into decision-making processes from the very beginning. Too often today, the existing commitment of youth fails due to a lack of opportunities. Expanding the opportunities for co-determination in education, but also in public affairs, is therefore one of the most important means of a meaningful youth policy. The demands of the SP: 1. opportunities for co-determination in education must be expanded. The competencies of existing representative bodies must be expanded and new ones created. 2. 2. young people must be better informed about social processes and sensitized to political issues. 3. 3. boys, like all other age groups, must be adequately represented in parliaments at all political levels. The goal is not an age quota but the promotion of young candidates and the support of youth political structures. 4. 4. young people do not get involved without rights: the voting age must be lowered to 16 at federal, cantonal and municipal level. 5 Existing structures such as youth parliaments must be supported and expanded. Youth organizations and youth-specific projects in all areas of society must be increasingly supported and promoted. 12. aging with dignity In today's civic discourse, older people are often merely causes of problems, burdens on younger generations, and a threat to the balance of social insurance. It is not so and it must not be so. With their skills and experience, senior citizens contribute much to the human wealth of our society. They take on indispensable tasks in the family and neighborhood, in associations and the community. Switzerland does not need a policy for the elderly, but a policy with them. The demands of the SP: 1. financial security is an important prerequisite for old age with dignity. Independent living in stimulating surroundings (no old-age ghettos) and the possibility of participating in cultural and social activities and events also have an influence on the health and well-being of the elderly. Around one-third of pensioners are needy: they need social insurance that gives them sufficient financial security. 2 The rigid retirement age has had its day. The retirement age must be adapted to people and the reality of work. Anyone who completes 40 years of gainful employment or parenting and caregiving years or has a low income should be able to draw an unreduced AHV pension in advance. This inclusion of unpaid work takes particular account of the typical life patterns of women, who are often worse off in old age due to interruptions in their employment. The 11th AHV revision must be guided by this principle. Conversely, it should also be possible, if desired, to draw the AHV pension at a later point in time. The current tendencies in the Swiss health care system point in the direction of two-tier medicine. For older people in particular, it is important in this context that solidarity between the healthy and the sick, between the old and the young, between men and women, and between the rich and the poor be permanently anchored in the compulsory health insurance system in the form of a reorganized risk equalization system. This will enable better and more cost-effective health care in old age. Another decisive factor for the quality of life in old age is the transfer from inpatient to outpatient care and thus the possibility of being able to live in a familiar environment for as long as possible. The existing age limits for holding political office, which currently exclude a large proportion of pensioners from federal commissions, for example, must be lifted. 13. family policy Children and young people need care, education and a secure existence. In Switzerland, more than in almost any other European country, obstacles are placed in the way of them and the adults who live with them and care for them. There is a shortage of supplementary family childcare places. Child allowances vary from canton to canton and are also paid only to employed persons. More and more families are struggling to earn a sufficient income. Switzerland is the only country in Europe that does not have maternity insurance. The demands of the SP: 1. a paid maternity leave of at least 14 weeks after the birth. The salary during maternity leave is financed by the employer; 2. measures to reconcile work and family life, such as childcare places to complement family life, block times and lunchtimes at schools; 3. improved framework conditions for single parents, in particular financial support and flexible childcare options (e.g. also in the evenings and at weekends); 4. new working time models in the economy and in the public sector that support the redistribution of gainful employment and family work; 5. a tax system that promotes the egalitarian distribution of gainful employment and family work among couples. At the heart of this is the introduction of individual taxation. 6. a living wage for children of at least CHF 530 per month for the first child and CHF 265 per month for each additional child. The child pension replaces the previous, unfair system of tax deductions and child allowances. In the medium term, it will be raised to a subsistence level of 600 francs for the first child and 300 francs for subsequent children. 7. 7. income-dependent supplementary benefits for parents who have to limit their gainful employment so much because of children that their wages are no longer sufficient to secure their livelihood; 8. better consideration of the situation of foreign families in Switzerland, in particular intensified integration efforts to improve the starting chances of children of migrants; 9. recognition of the diversity of different ways of life and a ban on discrimination on the basis of cohabitation. In particular, same-sex couples are to be given equal legal status. In order to support families in the demanding task of raising children, there is a need for reliable day schools with block times, lunch, free subject offerings and task supervision as well as supplementary family care (after-school care, crèches, day care associations, etc.). 14. migration policy in the balance of interests Economic development has made Switzerland a country of immigration since the end of the 19th century. It therefore has an above-average proportion of foreign residents. These people are correspondingly important for our country, we depend on them. Their exclusion and discrimination is therefore disastrous, xenophobia and racism must be fought. Integration is not a one-way street. It requires a mutual approach in all areas of life. This includes building networks in the public and private sectors and providing access to government facilities. Integration into the labor market is of central importance. The integration of foreigners is unthinkable without access to political rights and to the possibility of acquiring Swiss citizenship under reasonable conditions. In shaping current migration policy, various aspects must be taken into account: the interests of foreigners seeking work in our country must be balanced with those of native workers in low unemployment and in protection against the deterioration of their working conditions. Therefore, the SP agrees to the free movement of persons within the framework of European integration (Bilateral Agreements) if accompanying measures against social dumping and wage pressure are adopted at the same time. Demands of the SP 1) The adoption of accompanying measures in the economic and social spheres will take place at the same time as the ratification of the bilateral agreements with the EU in order to prevent social dumping and wage pressure. 2. the admission of immigrants from non-EU countries will not be decided solely on the basis of their professional skills. Social skills or emergency situations are also taken into account so that women also have a chance. In order to broaden the scope of admission, Switzerland also promotes educational exchange programs with students and young workers from developing countries. 3. learning a national language is an effective means of integration and is supported as such. This effort is required of migrants - also as a prerequisite for the granting of municipal and cantonal voting and election rights to settled foreigners. 4. violations of the rule of law and serious misconduct in the sense of criminal law must be punished. The law is applicable to all. The SP Switzerland rejects special laws for foreigners. 5. In order to promote integration, there is a need for more school development projects with smaller classes, team teaching, support for students with special needs by specialists and advice for teachers. 15. refugee policy: the right to asylum knows no exceptions The preservation and protection of human dignity are among the most important fundamental values. The SP has therefore been committed to international solidarity since its inception, for the right to a dignified existence, for the reception of politically persecuted people, people threatened by war and civil wars and for development cooperation. The first goal, however, must be to prevent the emergence of reasons for flight, such as armed conflict or economic collapse. Switzerland's refugee policy must be aligned with these goals. The UN Refugee Agency has counted 40 million refugees worldwide. Most of them are in countries immediately neighboring their crisis-ridden country of origin. Around 100,000 have been taken in by Switzerland, half of whom are asylum seekers and will soon have to leave Switzerland again. In total, this is only o.25% (2.5 per mil) of all refugees. This shows that Switzerland does little more than other states and does nothing more than its international duty in relation to its population. The demands of the SP: 1. the 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees must not be undermined. Anyone whose life and limb is in danger is entitled to protection and must be given temporary or permanent admission, regardless of skin color, origin, religion or gender. 2. the number of refugees who apply for asylum in our country results from the conflicts in different areas of the world. Cooperation with other states in the area of asylum is being expanded, and solutions are being developed internationally. Switzerland is therefore stepping up its involvement in international organizations and helping to prevent conflicts. 3. People become refugees as a result of armed conflicts. The task of the international community in such conflicts is to intervene more quickly and effectively to end them. In the future, internationally coordinated aid on the ground will become increasingly important. Targeted aid measures must be taken to prevent refugees from having to leave their country in the first place. Switzerland must become more involved in this relationship. 4. the EU states have adopted the Dublin first asylum agreement, which allows refugees to apply for asylum in only one European country. Because Switzerland is not a member of the EU, all refugees rejected in an EU country can apply for admission in Switzerland again. For the SP Switzerland, accession to the EU is also urgent because in this way Switzerland can coordinate its asylum policy with the other EU countries and cooperate in the creation of a more humanitarian Europe-wide refugee policy. The counterproductive ban on work for asylum seekers and collectively accepted persons must be lifted. This ban is intended to reduce Switzerland's attractiveness as a country of asylum. At the same time, however, the danger of antisocial behavior, petty crime and flight into moonlighting is promoted. 6. Refugees who have to leave their country in large numbers due to armed conflicts and who apply for asylum in our country should be taken in collectively, cared for as well as possible in our country and prepared for collective repatriation. Work and education are a better preparation for the reconstruction of the country of origin than waiting idly in collective housing. 7. Wherever possible, collectively housed persons should be accommodated privately, e.g. with relatives. However, this does not release the state from its integration policy measures towards these people. Those who take in refugees must not be left alone with these tasks. 8. return migrants should be offered material and non-material assistance. Special emphasis should be placed on the development of local educational structures and training opportunities for returnees. 9. Asylum seekers who receive definitive refugee status must be integrated into our country as quickly and as well as possible. 16. strengthen democracy Swiss democracy is under pressure and in need of renewal. There are several reasons for this. For example, the political room for maneuver of democratically constituted nation states is visibly being restricted by the consequences of globalization and regional integration. Given the growing pace and complexity of politics, the militia parliament has long since reached its limits. The executive branch is becoming more and more dominant. The financially weak parties, originally organizers of democratic culture, see themselves more and more crushed by financially strong associations and individuals such as Blocher, Frey, Schweri and others. Small-scale federalism has also reached its limits. To solve problems, more and more supra-regional concordats, special-purpose associations and the like are being set up, to which the cantonal parliaments can still say yes or no, but no longer have an effective say. Democracy also needs free, mature and informed citizens with secure fundamental rights. The exponentially growing private and state databases (""transparent man""), for example, call this into question. In addition to this negative side of the information society, it also provides new instruments that must be used for democracy. Switzerland's semi-direct democracy is complex and needs a certain balance. With direct democracy, the ""people"" can take corrective action, propose new solutions, or even prevent them. With the elections, it elects representatives to parliament who control the Federal Council and the administration, advise on draft laws and initiate laws themselves. Direct democracy cannot replace this controlling and advisory function. Those who fight against the classe politique and want to circumvent the Federal Council and Parliament with the people's rights are therefore making a mockery of Swiss democracy. By rhetorically bypassing the rights of the people, these circles are pursuing a plebiscitary democracy in which the people are to be abused and manipulated for their own interests with campaigns worth millions. Instead of such a weakening, the SP wants a strengthening of democracy in Switzerland and in Europe. The demands of the SP 1. with EU accession, democratically constituted Switzerland would greatly increase its capacity to act. As a fully-fledged EU member, Switzerland could commit itself to strengthening democracy in the EU. 2. at the latest with EU accession, the parliament must be (partially) professionalized and raised to European standards. Considerably more resources must be made available to him or to the parliamentary groups. In connection with EU accession, the SP proposes the introduction of a constructive referendum with the submitted popular initiative. This can be supplemented by a popular motion obliging the Federal Council to become involved in Brussels in a certain sense. 4. The political parties must be specially promoted for their democratic functions, if democracy is not to become the plaything of a privileged few and thus a quasi-private matter. 5. a reform of federalism is needed that restores and develops democratic rights. It makes sense to combine such a reform with a territorial reform. 6. 1 Democracy needs transparency and information and therefore the fundamental publicity of the administration (""transparent administration""). Greater transparency also requires an accelerated handling of petitions for referendums by the administration and parliament. 7) The current majority of the cantons is outdated and must be abolished. 8. the legislative initiative, which already exists in the cantons, could be used to influence legislation more quickly and more directly. 9) Democracy and co-determination must not be limited to politics in the narrower sense, but must be extended to areas such as the economy or universities. 10. voting rights for foreigners must be introduced at least at communal and cantonal level. 17 Shaping globalization politically The balance of accelerated globalization and internationalization - especially of the economy - is appalling when measured against the gain in prosperity for the people of this world, as the latest Human Development Report of the UN Development Program UNDP again dramatically demonstrates. But even the recent financial crises do not prevent the promoters of neoliberal economic policy from continuing to focus on and push for accelerated liberalization and deregulation. For example, the International Monetary Fund is to be given a new mandate to promote the liberalization of capital movements (investment), and a new round of WTO negotiations is to be launched at a ministerial meeting in Seattle at the end of November 1999. As liberalization and deregulation progress, more and more vital areas are slipping out of political control. Nowhere is this more visible than with multinationals, for example in food production, where the monopolized merging of industrial food production, pharmaceutical and chemical corporations, genetic engineering and biological piracy in developing countries is destroying traditional and sustainable forms of production, making farmers dependent, shamelessly exploiting countries and deliberately undermining consumers' freedom of choice. After all, even the power of corporations is not completely limitless: the OECD's work on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) was halted due to international opposition, or genetic products are being withdrawn from the product range again in Western Europe. Resistance also shows results. Demands of the SP 1 Switzerland must be a member of all international organizations where decisions relevant to global development are made. Specifically, it must quickly join the UN and the EU. General guidelines for its actions must be the UN human rights covenants and it must seek alliance with progressive countries in international organizations. The goal is to regain the ability to shape policy through reform of these organizations. 2 The next WTO negotiating round (Millennium Round) comes too early. Not even all of the Uruguay Round agreements have been implemented, let alone evaluated. The first, rough balance for developing countries is negative. They are also overburdened in terms of resources (e.g. experts, legal and institutional know-how). The next round must therefore be postponed. 3. fundamental progress must be made in the development of trade-related social and environmental clauses. Switzerland must work to ensure that developing countries are supported in this process financially, with know-how and with transitional provisions, and that such clauses are not misused by the industrialized countries as a pretext for new protectionism. (4) Switzerland supports the creation of an international antitrust law and an international antitrust authority. The recent financial crises show the need for a new international financial architecture and a reform of the IMF policy, which is designed for sustainable growth and integrated into the policies of the UN organizations and the World Bank. Switzerland must make direct or indirect capital controls (such as the Tobin Tax) an issue. Private creditors will have to better share the costs of financial crises in the future. This also requires the introduction of international insolvency law. Without such fundamental reforms, further liberalization steps must be fought all the more. 6. 6 Switzerland also has the possibility to take autonomous measures in favor of a solidary and just policy. -It places an emphasis on conflict prevention, peace promotion and development cooperation. This includes strengthening its involvement in the OSCE and the Council of Europe. To this end, it is using the 600 million francs freed up annually by the redistribution of military spending. Switzerland also advocates internationally for a comprehensive ban on all weapons of mass destruction and for a curb on the trade in conventional war materials. It also needs stricter implementation of the Goods Control Act and the War Material Act (including a ban on all war material exports that are incompatible with Switzerland's objectives). -It must rapidly increase development aid to 0.4% and later to 0.7% of GDP. -In international organizations, particularly the IMF and the World Bank, it advocates further debt relief on reasonable terms for highly indebted developing countries. -It reduces the attractiveness of Switzerland as a refuge for flight capital. -It sets incentives to greatly reduce its own consumption of resources. 18. for a cultural policy that expresses our social diversity Article 69 of the new Federal Constitution provides Switzerland with a basis for concrete cultural policy measures. Cultural activity is the core of social cohesion and source of dialogue. It not only helps to deal with differences, but also gives them a value. Consequently, it can have a conflict-inhibiting effect. It should also be borne in mind that a rich cultural life can have a positive impact on the economic development of a region. Demands of the SP: 1. the Confederation shall support the promotion of cultural events that strengthen exchange and better understanding between the different regions and social strata of our country. A better integration of the foreign population groups living with us can take place through cultural events, whereby both sides could benefit. 2) For the same reason, the Confederation is committed to increasing cultural exchanges with foreign countries, emphasizing our diversity. 3. it supports and develops creativity in the cultural field, ensuring as unhindered access as possible. Other priorities in the cultural field that should also be supported more generously: cultural animation, dissemination of works, education and research in the field of culture. 4. cultural events can be profitable and entice industry and business to invest. In order to prevent culture in regions away from the economic centers from being disadvantaged, the federal government is providing increased political and financial support for cultural projects in peripheral regions. 5. Switzerland has developed into an important art market. However, it does not have a law regulating the import and export of cultural goods (the only country in Europe to do so). In order to overcome the legal vacuum concerning the illegal trade in (stolen) works of art, the Confederation should take the necessary steps to ratify the UNESCO Convention of 1970 (concerning the protection and international exchange of cultural property) and sign the Unidroit Convention of 1995 (concerning the return of stolen cultural property, cultural property derived from illegal excavations and the return of illicitly exported cultural property)."
43320,200310,"Equality, social security and quality of life! Election platform of the SP Switzerland for the federal elections 2003 Adopted by the Party Congress of the SP Switzerland on October 20, 2002 in Zurich 1. globalization: Global solidarity and justice instead of liberalization. For decades, states, political parties and trade unions concentrated their activities too much on the national level. At the same time, multinational corporations benefited from accelerated globalization. The consequences are devastating: the rights of the population in poor countries are being ignored. Today, globalization largely means liberalization, leading to further destruction of livelihoods for millions of people, especially in poor countries with lacking or weak democratic structures. This primarily affects women, children and young people. Today, this globalization is driving millions of people to flee their homes. The SP is convinced that globalization will only lead to greater prosperity and social justice if it is based on a democratically regulated world economy and equal cooperation between North and South. As the home country of many globally active corporations and due to the weight of its financial center, Switzerland has a special obligation to be strongly committed to global solidarity as a UN member. The SP shows how consumers can support local and regional economies and fair trade. In doing so, it supports alternative forms of economic activity: cooperatives, collectives and self-help groups. The demands of the SP: 1) Switzerland must continue the development cooperation that strengthens civil society. and contributes to more peace. 2) Switzerland should invest in development cooperation programs that build on the key economic importance of women and which, on the other hand, combat the socially rooted discrimination and exploitation of women and children. 3. public funds for development aid should be increased to 0.7 percent of gross domestic product (current level: 0.34 percent). 4. the aid organizations' debt relief petition must serve as a guideline for the debt cancellation of economically weak countries. The debts of these countries should therefore be written off, that are undergoing a democratization process must meet ""good governance"" guidelines, Concerned about social justice and peace and ecological responsibility. 5 Switzerland must actively promote human rights in the UN. 6. within the framework of the UN, the WTO and all organizations concerned, Switzerland must work to ensure that these organizations no longer base their actions on financial and commercial criteria in an abusive manner, but instead respect human rights. and bring social rights back to the fore. The SP must take on the task of reviewing the coherence and internal balance of Swiss foreign policy, so that it does not simply bow to economic interests. 7 Switzerland must intervene at the UN so that international organizations such as WHO, UNICEF, ILO, etc. are given more power and become a real alternative to the World Bank's and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 8 Switzerland must advocate a revision of the WTO agreement on intellectual property (TRIPS) so that developing and emerging countries can afford essential goods (e.g. medicines, seeds), even if these goods are protected by patents. 9 Switzerland must advocate a revision of the WTO agreement on agriculture in such a way that the right to food security is also guaranteed for the countries of the South. It is therefore calling on the countries of the North to abolish export subsidies for their agricultural products. 10 Switzerland must work within the WTO to ensure that international trade complies with the social provisions of the International Labor Organization (ILO). and environmental protection regulations are applied. 11 Switzerland must advocate a revision of the services agreement in the WTO in such a way that the service sectors that are indispensable for the population (energy, health, education, telecommunications, transport, etc.) are not privatized but are expanded as public services. 12. as a signatory state, Switzerland must make every effort to ensure compliance with the Geneva Conventions. 13. banking secrecy as a means of covering up tax evasion must be abolished. Administrative assistance to democratic states in cases of tax evasion and tax avoidance must be granted. 14. A global Tobin tax must be introduced to tax all currency transactions in order to put a stop to speculative international currency transactions. 2. economic policy: More growth, more ecology and more social justice The 1990s were a lost decade for Switzerland economically. Unlike all other OECD countries, it experienced seven years of zero growth. Also because of the economic stagnation, the ecological transformation did not get off the ground. At the same time, incomes and wealth were distributed more unequally, which prolonged the stagnation. A comparison with countries such as Austria or Luxembourg shows: As an EU member, Switzerland would not have had any unproductive discussions about the state quota, fewer jobs lost, less pressure on the welfare state and higher real incomes and wealth for the majority of the population. Because economic structural change, social justice and ecological restructuring are the defining elements of economic policy, the SP considers strong and at the same time sustainable economic growth to be achievable and necessary. The SP primarily wants to improve the situation of people on low and middle incomes. and small and medium-sized enterprises and secure a fair share of assets and income for women. At the same time, it advocates an international economic policy based on solidarity. The demands of the SP: 1. economic policy must exploit the annual growth potential of two to three percent. 2. economic policy must bring about a more equitable distribution of social wealth, income and assets. 3. economic growth and resource consumption must be reconciled. This is possible thanks to technological progress. 4) Ecological taxes must be neutral in terms of state quotas and must not prevent a more socially just tax system. 5. good education and training opportunities must exist to promote the location, because people are the most valuable potential of the Swiss economy. In particular, training courses and sufficient jobs for less qualified employees must be created. 6. An efficient and good public service must be offered and maintained, because it is a key locational advantage. It must not be deregulated or privatized. 7. 7. an active industrial and technology policy must be pursued that ensures value creation in Switzerland. This includes strengthening the transfer of technology from universities and universities of applied sciences to industry (spin-off promotion). Energy standards for all building types, such as the Minergie standard, must be introduced, as this reduces energy consumption and construction costs and creates new, innovative jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises. The construction industry must become environmentally friendly. 9. fair loans must be made available for company founders (startups) and small and medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, the reactivation of the commercial guarantee system is necessary, and good credit conditions for SMEs must be created. 10. regional policy instruments, such as the Bonny decision, must be strengthened. 3. full employment: Secure jobs and fairer wages. Between 1990 and 2000, labor productivity rose by around ten percent, while the purchasing power of wages increased by only 2.6 percent. On the other hand, the compensation of many top managers and board members increased sharply. During the crisis of the 1990s, a massive redistribution of income took place at the expense of wage earners, on the one hand between high and low incomes, and on the other between capital and labor. In Switzerland, almost half a million people (mainly young families and single women) live in households whose income is not enough to live on, despite full-time employment. Structural change and the flexibilization of many employment relationships are leading to massive uncertainty. The SP's most important economic policy goal remains full employment based on fair wages for all. The wages must secure the existence. Only a redistribution of paid and unpaid work and legally regulated minimum wages will lead to more justice and self-reliance. Wage earners are entitled to an increasing share of productivity progress - both by reducing working hours as well as with real wage increases. The state and the National Bank should pursue an anti-cyclical policy and a monetary policy geared towards the interests of the economy as a whole. The demands of the SP: 1. the federal government, cantons and municipalities must contribute to full employment by pursuing a countercyclical fiscal policy (despite the debt brake). The National Bank must help to secure employment and growth with its monetary policy and abandon the dogma of the ""strong franc. 3. minimum wages must be set by law in order to guarantee a satisfactory existence for everyone in full-time gainful employment in the future. Until these are guaranteed by law and/or by means of collective labor agreements, companies without minimum wage guarantees will not receive any public contracts or subsidies. A net salary of CHF 3,000 should be prescribed as the statutory minimum wage. 4. working hours in Switzerland should be gradually reduced to the 35-hour week. 5. working time models must be offered that ensure that men can also take on parenting and care work. 6. part-time employees must not be paid nor in terms of promotion opportunities, or disadvantaged in terms of social security cover. 7. a consistent gender equality policy must enable the integration of both genders into the economy. As the economy needs the potential of women, equality serves the whole society. This must be achieved through the fair distribution of socially necessary work between the sexes. The constitutional principle of ""equal pay for equal work"" must finally be implemented everywhere. 9. 9. social plans and their financial protection must become part of a modernized labor law. 10. active labor market measures with training and retraining measures must be provided and employment programs prepared to help alleviate unemployment in good time and to enable disadvantaged persons in the process of structural change to find new employment. 4. economic democracy: More quality of life and efficiency thanks to more democracy. Scandals involving gigantic manager salaries, excessive board fees and exorbitant severance payments for the top management of large companies combined with poor performance made for inglorious headlines. ABB, Zurich Insurance, Swissair and Crédit Suisse top this ""hit list"". Wage earners paid the price for poor management performance with job losses and through the devaluation of their investments, especially pension fund assets. More transparency and more democracy are central to the SP in business. A revision of the Labor Code must initiate a fundamental shift in rights in favor of employees. In addition to wage earners, in future shareholders will also need and in particular the minority shareholders more rights. The SP is committed to the concrete and rapid implementation of corporate governance. The co-determination rights of wage earners contribute to the fact that companies are able to achieve and ecologically efficient economic activity. The demands of the SP: 1. the means of the collective labor agreement must be protected and extended. If one third of the employees and their trade union representatives in an industry demand it, a collective labor agreement in an industry must be declared generally binding. The tripartite commissions must monitor this, that the implementation of the bilateral agreements with the EU is well and democratic. 2. co-determination without access to files makes no sense. Works commissions and trade union representatives therefore have the right to inspect the accounts. and the minutes of the governing bodies of their company. 3. a new federal works constitution law must be created that expands the participation and co-determination rights of wage earners and their trade unions. Members of employee commissions, employee committees and trade union representatives may only be dismissed by mutual agreement. 4. protection against dismissal must be improved. In particular, abusive dismissals must be declared null and void. 5. companies that want to lay off staff must first negotiate with the trade unions in the industries concerned. A social plan is to be prepared in negotiations. A retraining plan for the employee shall be prepared at the expense of the enterprise. The organization of the educational courses has to be done in cooperation with the trade unions. Preparations must be made for early retirement; Retirement from the age of 60 must be possible without loss of salary. 6. parity funds must be set up to guarantee the payment of social plan benefits, because the best social plan is useless if there is no money left in the event of bankruptcy. 7. gender mainstreaming must be part of the management tools of top management, because gender equality is an indispensable management task. Management must provide information on enforcement in the annual reports. 8. with more labor inspectors and with improved occupational medicine, the working conditions in the companies can be optimized. 9. two measures must be implemented against undeclared work: Tougher action against employers who employ people illegally and a regularization of ""sans-papiers"" according to uniform criteria. 10. the boards of trustees of pension funds and the representatives of employees' associations must ensure that the pension capital is invested in companies with a high social responsibility, ecological and economic democratic standards. 11. a revision of the law is intended to strengthen the minority rights of investors. This includes, in particular, better control possibilities. 12. since the salaries and other emoluments of the management as well as the compensation of the members of the board of directors today have an economically relevant dimension for the company, the general meeting of shareholders must know these amounts, not only the total amounts but individually, in order to be able to correct them. For reasons of transparency, the allocation of duties and responsibilities of members of boards of directors must also be known. 13. 13. the activities of auditing companies must be more clearly regulated, and misconduct must be subject to criminal law. It is mandatory for the auditing companies to provide information on any criminal offenses that have been identified. The establishment of cooperatives must be promoted and simplified. 15. 15. the seal of approval ""publicly owned company"" must be subject to greater democratic control. 5. consumption: Better goods and services for less money. Wage earners in the high-price island of Switzerland are getting less and less for their money: rents in Switzerland are 80 percent higher than the EU average. Rising health care costs are borne primarily by middle-income wage earners because of cuts in public subsidies and antisocial per capita premiums. If agriculture already receives four billion francs in subsidies, the SP expects it to produce natural and sustainable food at decent prices. The prices of many imported goods are - despite the strong Swiss franc - more than 20 percent more expensive than in neighboring countries. The SP demands that consumers get more for their disposable income. This requires effective measures on rents, health insurance premiums and the prices of imported products. Among other things, a clear declaration obligation and more consumer rights strengthen the position of consumers. More purchasing power for consumers also means a strengthening of Switzerland as a business location. The demands of the SP: The Department of Economic Affairs must present a package of measures for the next four years to combat Switzerland as a high-price island. These include the right to parallel imports from the European area and a massive tightening of antitrust law. The companies that import these goods must comply with the environmental protection regulations applicable in the respective countries of origin, the provisions on employee protection and respect the regulations of the International Labor Office. The public service and culturally valuable goods (e.g. books) are not subject to antitrust law. 2. effective sanctions against cartels must be applied to prevent vertical price fixing and the prevent abusive exploitation of the market position by private companies with market power. 3. to promote fair trade through government regulations and the recognition of consumers' rights. 4. the right of consumers to a secure, high-quality and affordable basic postal service, Telecommunications, Current, Water and health and public transport must be guaranteed. 5. the consumer's right to information, on transparency and representation in political processes must also be guaranteed. 6. the health and the protection against deception and the right to sue associations must be expanded. 7. consumer rights in the areas of product safety, Warranty services, Declaration obligation, Insurance cover, Depositor protection, Sales law etc. must be designed in accordance with European standards. 8. food policy must aim for healthy and sustainably produced food at reasonable prices and promote local products worldwide. 9. tenants must be guaranteed protection against dismissal, which only permits dismissals for justified reasons. 10. tenancy law must be revised in such a way that rents are decoupled from the constant ups and downs of mortgage interest rates. A cost rent model must be used to curb steep rent increases at the beginning of a lease, after a change of hands or renovations. 11. The land price explosion must be curbed by measures against the hoarding of building land, by targeted land purchases by the public sector and by effective taxation of undeveloped building land. 6. family policy: A child-friendly society for families with a future. For many women and men, family and career can still rarely be reconciled to the satisfaction of both sexes. The bourgeois family policy brought little or nothing to families: the cost of living for families increased massively, the tax reductions only benefit the very highest incomes. Due to a lack of childcare places, many women in Switzerland involuntarily forgo satisfying gainful employment that corresponds to their education. Statistics show: Children have become a risk of poverty for many families in Switzerland. The SP wants a social environment in which children can grow up carefree and discover the world. Family policy measures initiated by the SP are intended to improve development opportunities for children. For the SP, it is intolerable that couples who decide to have children end up in material hardship as a result. That's why we need financial relief for families, enough childcare places and working hours that allow work and family to coexist. The demands of the SP: 1. paid parental leave must finally be realized; likewise parental leave and paid time off to care for sick children. 2. fathers want (or need) to be involved in the responsibility for raising children and family work. Therefore, working time models are needed that support a redistribution of gainful employment and family work. 3. ... Being a father, on the other hand, is very important: Parents must be given the opportunity for training and counseling. 4. a paid maternity leave of 16 weeks after birth must be introduced. 5. families with middle and lower incomes must be relieved by replacing the current child deductions with tax credits that are deducted directly from the tax amount. 6) ""One child, one allowance"" must be implemented as a principle in order to abolish cantonal discrimination in child allowances throughout Switzerland. 7. family supplementary benefits for low-income families must be introduced nationwide. 8. families must be helped with free health insurance for children. 9. affordable housing for families must be made available. 10) More funds for integration programs for children and parents from immigrant families are essential. 11. 10-year start-up financing by the federal government for the creation of childcare places is an initial success of the SP. Municipalities and cantons must now ensure that the federal money is translated into concrete crèches. 12. companies benefit from daycare centers. They should therefore contribute to the financing of childcare places above a certain size. 13. to improve the situation for families, fixed block times from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. with a voluntary lunch service should be introduced as well as courses and childcare services for the off-peak hours until 6 p.m. 14. schools should be provided with more financial resources to enable effective violence prevention and the learning of conflict resolution strategies. 15. by means of prevention work against tobacco, alcohol and other legal or illegal drug abuse and to help children and young people against suicide. 16. free spaces must be created for children and young people. Buildings suitable for children and safe routes to school must be created, because they belong to a settlement. 17. Children and young people must be given the opportunity for democratic co-determination. The Confederation shall support municipalities and cantons in this. 18. Incentives and legal forms for solidarity-based communities and for intergenerational and gender-independent forms of living shall be supported. 7. health policy: Health must remain affordable. Although Swiss health policy is generally considered to be of high quality, the constantly rising health insurance premiums reveal two main problems: Switzerland is the only country in Europe to have the unsocial capitation premium for compulsory health insurance, which burdens families and insured persons with small and medium incomes in particular to the point of pain. In addition, the federal government has too few powers to effectively coordinate the health policies of the cantons and thus avoid costly duplication. With its popular initiative ""Health must remain affordable"", the SP wants health insurance premiums to be dependent on income and assets and thus provide financial relief for 80 percent of the population. The Confederation needs more competencies vis-à-vis the cantons in order to coordinate cost-driving cutting-edge medicine. Competition between health insurers has not yet brought any benefits. With a national single health insurance fund, we can ensure cost transparency, quality and lower costs. The SP does not want two-tier medicine and opposes the cancellation of benefits in mandatory health insurance. The demands of the SP: 1. the unsocial per capita premiums must be replaced by income- and wealth-related premiums. As an immediate measure, a rapid reduction in health insurance premiums for families and households with small and medium incomes must be implemented. 2. 2) All cantons must make full use of the health insurance premium reductions. 3. the cost of medicines in Switzerland must finally reach the European level (average of the EU countries). This requires a more systematic promotion of generics as well as the approval of parallel imports. In addition, physicians' offices and pharmacies should be required by law to prescribe the lowest-priced medication. 4. 4. the price of medicines should be lowered by adjusting the size of the packages, using medicines sparingly and only selling medicines to doctors in emergencies. 5. no benefits may be cancelled from the basic insurance. On the other hand, national planning of health care benefits must be introduced. An efficient national health insurance system must eliminate the inefficient bureaucracy and the costly pseudo-competition of the current health insurance funds. The federal government and the cantons must create clear regulations for better working conditions for nursing staff and for the financing of nursing homes. Wages in the retirement and nursing homes must correspond to those of employees in public hospitals. 8. the increase in the number of doctors is causing high costs at the expense of the insured: this development must be stopped with nationwide GP models, networks of doctors for quality assurance, a patient card and global budgets in the outpatient sector. At the same time, efforts in the area of prevention and health education (risk behavior, self-responsibility, etc.) must be initiated or supported at all levels. 9. 9 Long-term sick persons, who are often poorly protected, must be given better protection by means of a nationally regulated daily sickness benefit insurance. The state must ensure by law that all employees in Switzerland have daily allowance insurance that covers at least 80% of their gross salary in the event of illness. 10. human genetic material must not be patented. 11) The medically controlled distribution of heroin to severely addicted persons has proven its worth. Therefore, it must continue to be significantly expanded medically and socially. Soft drugs (cannabis) must be legalized and the use of hard drugs must become unpunishable. Drug policy must expand prevention for all addictive substances (legal and illegal). 12. The World Health Organization (WHO) must regain its independence and no longer take a back seat to economic and military-technocratic interests. The agreement that the WHO has reached on all health issues relating to ionizing radiation (minimization of the Chernobyl effect, issue of attenuated uranium, etc.) to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) must be repealed. 8. social policy: A denser social safety net. In Switzerland, many people continue to fall through the social security net. Those who have only an AHV pension in old age cannot live on it because, despite the constitutional mandate, the AHV does not cover subsistence. Those who work part-time and earn little are still not entitled to the second pillar. Although there are still gaps in social security, the conservative parties want to prevent the expansion of the social security system. They deliberately exaggerate the financing issues and, with the debt brake, ensure that the state becomes increasingly antisocial. The SP fights for social security and justice. Closing the existing gaps in the social network is necessary and possible. We are thinking in particular of those who tend to be poor, such as families, young people and single parents. Switzerland is one of the richest countries in the world and can afford a good social policy. The expansion and safeguarding of social security systems can be financed. Whether it remains possible to grow old with dignity and material security is a political decision, as is standing up for the rights of people with disabilities and those in need of care. The SP is fighting to ensure that they can all count on the solidarity of society. The demands of the SP: 1. so that all people in our country can grow old without material hardship, we need AHV pensions that guarantee the minimum subsistence level. They must therefore be increased. 2) AHV and IV (disability insurance) require secure long-term financing. To this end, a range of measures is to be implemented: The surpluses of the EO (income replacement scheme) are to be transferred to the IV. The annual National Bank profits should be used to secure the AHV, as demanded by the KOSA popular initiative co-sponsored by the SP. If necessary, an increase in the value-added tax for the AHV should be provided for. People with lower incomes or part-time earners and the self-employed need a second pillar. Therefore, the coordination deduction for pension funds must be eliminated and the income from several part-time jobs must be added together for the pension fund. For employees with IV daily allowances, the IV must take over the employer's contribution of the second pillar (according to the percentage of invalidity ). 4. the weighting between AHV and pension fund must be shifted in favor of AHV. 5. a flexible retirement age is only fair if people with medium and lower incomes can also choose early or gradual retirement. After 40 years of contributions, it must be possible to draw the full pension. The AHV Act should be revised accordingly. 6 Pensions are indexed to inflation. and to real wage trends so that they do not lose their purchasing power. 7. people with disabilities need better access to buildings for their quality of life, to public transport and infrastructures. Obstacles to training are therefore and in the residential and the world of work. 8. persons with disabilities who are dependent on the assistance of third parties must be granted an assistance allowance so that they can afford this assistance. 9. the SKOS guidelines (SKOS: Swiss Conference for Social Assistance) must be applied in all cantons and adjusted annually to inflation. 10 To enable older people to live in their own homes for as long as possible, Spitex care with qualified staff is essential. and secure Spitex funding. Services such as home helpers and meal services play just as big a role as nursing assistance and must therefore be supported accordingly. 11. social policy must take account of the importance of affordable housing 12. the Confederation must take measures to support the municipalities in their neighborhood planning. The goal must be a housing mix that allows for a socially broad mix of population groups (seniors, families, youth, and foreigners), as this will encourage neighborhood support structures. 9. education: A good education for a self-determined life. Saving on education is short-sighted because necessary investments in the future are omitted. Despite this, education spending has been cut over the past decade. This austerity policy and the ever-increasing expectations increased the pressure on teachers and students. The Pisa study shows that our country is no longer among the top industrialized countries in terms of education. And it shows that children's social background has a significant impact on their success at school. Gender bias in career choices continues to impede equality in the workforce. Requiring government subsidies for private schools threatens our school system because it increases inequities and gives public schools even less funding. The SP demands the right of every child to an appropriate education, regardless of the financial situation of his or her family, gender, origin or place of residence. A well-developed education system is an investment in future generations and a guarantee for peaceful coexistence among people. Education is a task of the state; it must not be exposed to competition. The SP wants to greatly expand investment in the public school system. Structural change in the economy requires investment in lifelong learning. The demands of the SP: 1. since only the state can provide a good education to all, the school must remain a public task that needs more resources for quality assurance. State funding for private schools should be rejected. 2. to guarantee the right to education for all, are active support measures for the integration of children of immigrant parents or children with disabilities. 3. the school of tomorrow must be more family-friendly and have affordable structures for all, such as block times, lunchtimes, homework help during off-peak hours. 4. the workforce must be supported by the public sector and companies responding to structural change with more further training and retraining. 5. the Confederation must support research projects and programs that promote gender equality in the classroom and create genuine equal opportunities. 6. functional illiteracy must be countered with state resources. 7. the Confederation must be given the authority to coordinate primary education in the 26 cantons. With an education framework article, the different 26 cantonal education systems are to be merged into an education area of Switzerland, since the current differences between the cantons are no longer justifiable in view of the increasing mobility. The Confederation must ensure uniform and sufficient scholarships in the cantons. Pupils and students who complete their education outside their place of residence receive a financial contribution towards their mobility costs independently of the scholarships. 9. for education, Further training and research need more resources. The additional money will primarily go towards modernizing vocational training, in the development of vocational training centers and in the increase in the credit line for education from 2004 to 2007, Research and technology. The aim should be an increase of 10 percent per annum. The Confederation and the cantons must create the conditions for the recognition of non-formally acquired competencies. Learning in work, family and leisure shall be treated as equivalent to learning in recognized educational institutions. 11. 11. trials shall be carried out throughout Switzerland for a basic level for children from the age of four. 12. equal opportunities shall be improved with smaller school classes. 13. to replace differentiated school types at secondary level 1 with advanced courses in the various subjects. This gives teachers more opportunities to respond to students' strengths and weaknesses. 14. foreign language teaching should start in the 1st grade of elementary school with the learning of a national language. More attention should be paid to mathematics and science education. 15. The Lipa initiative, which asks companies without apprentices to pay so that enough apprenticeships can be created, should be supported. 16. In order to do justice to the abilities of school leavers, flexible transitions should be created between apprenticeships and traineeships. On the other hand, the general vocational training in apprenticeships must be increased. 17. 17) The state must compensate small businesses in particular for the expenses incurred in the course of compulsory vocational internships. 18) The vocational choice programs for girls must be maintained. 19. in order to increase the attractiveness of vocational training and to promote equal treatment between high school students and apprentices, apprentices and young workers must be guaranteed 6 weeks of vacation. 20) Close cooperation between the individual Swiss universities and cooperation with European universities must be supported. The co-determination of students and the middle class at universities and universities of applied sciences is to be promoted. The Confederation must ensure the coordination of a socio-politically responsible implementation of the Bologna Declaration at Swiss universities. Universities have to adapt to the situation of working students. In particular, gender studies must be integrated into the individual scientific fields and a Swiss competence center for gender studies must be established. 21. The state institutions must participate in patents resulting from research at state institutions such as universities, the ETH, etc. and in their yield. 10. public safety: More safety through better prevention. Every society wants to provide security to its members. The feelings of insecurity and fear that are present in our society have many causes: The effects of ruthless neoliberal policies, the dismantling of public service networks, impending changes in the workplace, fears about material security in old age, or the loss of meaning in a society that is one-sidedly oriented toward economic performance. For the SP, the focus is on prevention. The best protection for people is a just society, Full employment, Material security and a well-developed education system. Repression, as propagated by parties on the right-wing fringe, does not lead to more security in society, but to more violence. In the area of public safety, the SP calls for greater prevention. This is only possible with appropriately oriented police work and sufficient financial resources and material. Prevention also includes urban and neighborhood planning that does not allow ghettos to develop, as well as measures to reduce the propensity to violence in society and partnerships. The fact is that more and more women, men and children are affected by domestic violence. The demands of the SP: 1. maintaining public safety in cities, neighborhoods and villages must be and remain a task of the police as a public service. It must therefore not be left to private companies or groups of citizens. 2) The planning aspect plays a major role in the design of public space: neighborhoods, buildings, squares and underpasses must therefore be designed in such a way that all people feel comfortable in public space. 3) The formation of ghettos should be prevented by intelligent planning, by mixing urban quarters and by supporting local structures that strengthen social networks (neighborhood assistance). 4. provide instruments to recognize desperate offenders in time and offer them professional help. Special attention must be paid to young people who may direct their acts of violence against third parties or against themselves. Women, children and men must be protected against domestic violence. Marital rape must become an official offense. 6. As a preventive measure against youth violence, the deployment of social workers and specially trained street workers must be increased. In this context, the various administrative agencies such as the youth ombudsman's office, youth workers, school, social and police departments must work closely together. The police resources must be redistributed to the neighborhoods. This requires permanently manned neighborhood posts with specially trained police officers and an organization that can respond quickly to calls from the population. The future police force should also consist of members of different cultural minorities. In this way, the acceptance of the police can be promoted. More women are also to be hired in the police and judicial apparatus. 9. well-trained railroad attendants are to be reintroduced. The ever-increasing electronic surveillance must be countered with better opportunities to inspect and object to the registered data and images. 10. 10. the establishment of a Swiss network for crime prevention must be sought. 11. in a new weapons law there must be no place for arms trafficking without a weapons license, and assault rifles must be stored in barracks and not at home. 11. traffic: Public transport as number 1. The transfer of transit goods traffic from road to rail, which was approved by the people, is progressing too slowly. The car lobby wants to further expand road traffic and attract even more heavy traffic with a second road tunnel at the Gotthard. The catastrophe at the Gotthard shows that an unreasonable traffic policy massively endangers the safety of road users. The bourgeois demands accept this development. At the same time, car lobbyists are trying to call into question the ecological transformation in transportation. Thus, they also threaten road safety. In contrast, the promotion of non-motorized traffic serves to improve safety and also health. The SP Switzerland has had a strong influence on Swiss transport policy: Theshift of freight traffic to the railways has been decided by the people, and public transport has been massively expanded. The SP guarantees that this reasonable and environmentally sound transport policy will be continued. The SP wants to increase traffic safety: It demands that transit trucks be checked more closely and that traffic hooligans be slowed down. Pedestrians and cyclists need continuous, safe and attractive connections. The demands of the SP: 1) Transport policy and spatial planning must be considered together. 2. the Confederation and the cantons are responsible for ensuring that the whole of Switzerland is well served by public transport. They must therefore contribute to the investment and operating costs of public agglomeration transport. As a minimum, there should be at least one connection per hour and direction in peripheral regions and a call bus at the normal fare in peripheral hours. Larger cities must be guaranteed 24-hour service. 3. Together with the regions, the federal government must ensure a better range of services in regional transport, i.e. higher frequencies, faster connections and, taking into account the rights of employees, also an expansion in the off-peak hours and at weekends. Each train must be accompanied by a conductor. 4. as an alternative to short-haul air traffic, Switzerland must be connected to the European high-speed lines. 5. the SBB must be spared the separation of infrastructure and operations according to the English model. 6) In order to increase traffic safety in built-up areas, a general speed limit of 30 km/h should be aimed for. In residential areas, speed limits of 30 km/h and other traffic-calming measures should be implemented to ensure safe routes to school and to increase the living space, especially for children. The ""Vision Zero"" project must be supported. 7. The increasingly important and necessary role of non-motorized traffic must be strengthened with the consistent promotion of safe and attractive bicycle and pedestrian paths. 8. disabled people must be guaranteed the right to their own movement. For the practical realization of this right, adapted means of transport must be offered to them. 9. The second tunnel tube at the Gotthard must not be built. Until the Neat tunnel is opened, a metering system that gives priority to regional traffic should be used as a reasonable replacement. Toilets, shower facilities and lounges for waiting truck drivers should be offered as a matter of course. 10. Investments (new locomotives, additional loading terminals also abroad, better access routes to the railroad tunnels, railroad logistics ) and market corrections (decent driver wages and regulated working hours) should enable and force a further shift of freight and vacation traffic to the rails. 11) With a penalty point system for traffic violations, a faster and automatic withdrawal of the driver's license for traffic hooligans is to be enforced. In the interest of driver safety, the police must massively expand traffic controls on trucks (rest time, alcohol, vehicle condition, weight limit). 13. car-sharing and organized carpooling should be used to promote traffic sanity. 12. environment: An intact environment for future generations. Switzerland lost its exemplary role in environmental protection, which it had gained in the early nineties. Neighboring countries have overtaken us in environmental policy. We are far from meeting our Kyoto commitments and reducing CO2 emissions. On the other hand, we are already feeling the effects of climate change in Switzerland: floods, a climate that is going crazy, the rise of the snow line and thus the threat to settlements in the Alpine region and negative consequences for Swiss tourism. The SP is committed to an intact environment and the protection of the basis of life on our planet and in Switzerland. There is no way around the fulfillment of international obligations (Kyoto commitments and reduction of CO2 emissions). This requires investments in energy efficiency, the promotion of alternative energies and the phasing out of nuclear energy. In addition to protecting our natural resources, environmental policy also includes water, Air and floor investments in sustainable economic growth. 3-liter car, Minergie houses and wind energy mean less economic resource consumption and more ecological growth. The demands of the SP: 1. the moratorium and phase-out initiative and the conversion of the electricity supply to 100 percent renewable energies are to be supported. 2. the affected population should have the right to veto the construction of nuclear waste storage facilities. The export of nuclear waste must be renounced. 3. 3. the particularly dangerous reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel rods must be abandoned. The ten-year moratorium is good, but it is not enough. 4. 4. an international organization for renewable energies must be created. Switzerland must withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 5. if the voluntary measures introduced for greater energy efficiency do not achieve the targets, a state quota-neutral CO2 levy should be introduced. 6. there should be a cost-covering feed-in remuneration and temporary start-up financing to promote renewable energies should be introduced. 7. the Minergie standard must be met in future when building in Switzerland as a standard that is rewarded with tax relief. 8. land reserves must be clearly separated between settlement and non-settlement areas as well as through denser construction in the existing settlement area. 9. since agriculture is not only used for food production, but is increasingly part of sustainable landscape development, direct payments should be linked to the ecological requirements of organic farming. 10. consistent species protection must be guaranteed, as well as the protection of the soil, of the water and the air. 11. the release of genetically modified organisms must be prohibited. The ban on genetically modified food must be strictly controlled. 12. 12. living beings must not be patented. Research on embryonic stem cells must be banned. 13. The emissions of air traffic are to be included in the reduction program of CO2 emissions. An international kerosene tax should be introduced. 14. the airports of Zurich, Basel and Geneva must cap the number of their flight movements at the 2002 level and a ban on night flights from 10 pm to 6 am. 15 Since noise is a nuisance, investments in noise protection along motorways are and tracks and along the railroad lines. 13. public service: Further development of the public service instead of privatization. Switzerland has a high-quality public service network in the areas of transport, communications, electricity, gas and water supply. Just two years ago, the Federal Council wanted to privatize Swisscom. Thanks to the resistance of the SP and the trade unions, it was possible to prevent this. Today, Swisscom is proving to be a good investment for the federal government. Privatisations in the public service sector are meeting with resolute resistance from the population at all levels. International competitive studies show that a good range of public services is a key locational advantage for Switzerland. History has also shown that privatization usually only results in private cartels that are more expensive for consumers. At its party conference in Lugano, the SP set the course for the future in terms of public services. It wants efficient state-owned enterprises and wants to expand their business areas. This applies in particular to Swisscom, Swiss Post and SBB. Privatization not only threatens supply, it also weakens the business location. The demands of the SP: 1. privatization and liberalization must no longer be tolerated. 2. profits from profitable areas of state-controlled companies such as Swiss Post, Swisscom or SBB must belong to the state. These profits can be used to subsidize non-profitable but necessary areas. 3. the pay and working conditions as well as the apprenticeships on offer in semi-public companies must be so good that they have an exemplary effect on private companies. 4. as natural monopolies, the supply networks for electricity, Gas and water belong to the public sector. The grids must remain in public ownership even in the event of outsourcing , and the public must have a say in services, tariffs and the public service mandate. 5. Since a publicly controlled electricity market better meets the needs of the population, there must be no room for a liberalized electricity market in the future. National investment and research programs must help to expand electricity production from renewable energies in such a way that perceptible minimum quotas become realistic goals. 7. the majority of Swisscom must remain in federal ownership and must be used to expand telecommunications services in Switzerland. Broadband must be part of the basic service, and the infrastructure must be expanded with a nationwide fiber-optic network. In future, changes in Swisscom's shareholdings will be subject to a referendum. 8. since liberalization of the postal service weakens the basic service, it must be the task of Swiss Post to maintain security of supply throughout Switzerland and to open up new business areas for the business location - for example with a postal bank. 9. the Confederation should work with its companies Post and Swisscom are taking on the role of pacemakers in mobile payment. 10. a diversity of journalistic offerings must be ensured at all levels. SRG, with its regional language radio and TV programs, has a special role to play as a public service company. 14th Financial Center: A clean Swiss financial center. The weight of the financial center is considerable. While its share of employment is 5%, it accounts for around 14% of the value added in the Swiss economy. Thanks to the financial center, Swiss interest rates are significantly lower than abroad. His transactions in the gray area, on the other hand, are a burden for the majority of the population. Capital flight to Switzerland leads to an overvaluation of the Swiss franc. At the same time, despite all protestations to the contrary, dictators' funds and accounts of mafia-like associations keep turning up. The SP has been fighting for decades for a Swiss financial center that is not associated with money laundering, dictators' money, non-transparent business practices and tax fraud. Nor does the SP consider tax evasion or customs fraud to be trivial offenses. Swiss banks should assert themselves with the quality of their services and not with the help of banking secrecy. The demands of the SP: 1. Switzerland may not permanently evade an international reporting procedure model for the taxation of interest and dividends. Nor should it distance itself from cooperation on joint EU regulation of banking secrecy. The most important financial centers outside the EU must be involved in this process, and Switzerland should also receive reciprocal benefits. 2. Switzerland must participate in the active fight against corruption and bribery within the framework of the international trade rules of the WTO and the World Bank. 3. tax evasion must become a punishable offence in Switzerland, so that the protection afforded by banking secrecy no longer applies. This should enable administrative assistance in cases of tax evasion and tax avoidance from abroad. 4. 4. a federal control authority with comprehensive powers is to be created to combat money laundering. It is to replace the current self-regulatory organizations for financial intermediaries. 5. stricter state control of the financial center is to be introduced by expanding the current banking supervision into a comprehensive financial market supervision with administrative judicial powers. 6) The public financial sector (cantonal banks, cooperative banks, Postfinance) should be strengthened as a counterpart to private-sector banks, especially to support small and medium-sized enterprises in their financing transactions. Because of the broader diversification of shares, depositor protection for small investors should be strengthened. 15. finances and taxes: More trust in the state thanks to tax justice. The taxes that burden the wallets of the general population have risen massively in recent years: value-added tax, fees and health insurance premiums. In Switzerland, it is primarily the middle class that pays the costs of the community. At the same time, companies and the rich are being courted with tax giveaways. The conservative parties are engaged in a populist tax-cutting race at the federal level and in many cantons. Their strategy is a policy of empty coffers: they program the deficits in the state budget for the next recession. A poor state is an unsocial state. The debt brake will further increase the pressure on government task fulfillment. The SP wants to establish tax justice. The first step is to eliminate tax loopholes. Second, this requires tax harmonization between the cantons. Third, realized capital gains of private individuals are taxable as income. The SP continues to advocate an anti-cyclical fiscal policy for the public sector: Deficits must be accepted in the recession in favor of investments and for social security, and debts can and must be repaid when the economy is good. The demands of the SP: (1) With the system change in the taxation of residential property (abolition of imputed rental value taxation and debt interest deduction), tax loopholes must be closed. If the change proves impracticable, at a minimum, a limitation on the debt interest deduction in the taxation of residential property should be provided. There is also a limit on the insurable salary in the second pillar, for deposits in the second and the deductions for the third pillar. 2. the excessive and harmful tax competition between the cantons and municipalities must be stopped with a national material tax harmonization. 3. families and households with small and middle incomes must be given tax relief. 4. instead of tax reductions, companies should be supported by promoting technology transfer between SMEs and universities and universities of applied sciences. 5. a federal inheritance and gift tax with an exemption limit of one million francs should be introduced. 6. a participation gains tax should be introduced to cover the profit from the sale of significant participations in a corporation or cooperative. 7. a capital gains tax must be provided for real estate gains that are not covered by federal tax. 16. Europe and Democracy: With Europe to more democracy, social security and peace. No state can solve the essential problems of our time on its own. The bilateral path between the EU and Switzerland can only be expanded to a limited extent. Economically, an existence as an island in Europe is impossible for Switzerland: The high exchange rate of the franc would be ruinous for the export industry, Switzerland would become too expensive for tourists, and the cost of living would be too high for the Swiss. Social security and democracy also lose their weight in the face of globalization if they are limited to the nation state. If the Swiss want to continue to democratically shape their common living conditions, they must help to ensure that democracy is also anchored transnationally within the framework of a federalist European constitution. No one does more for peace in Europe than the EU. Today in Europe, what belongs together is growing together: East and West, privileged and disadvantaged. Switzerland cannot only benefit from this compensation. Especially now it would be in demand with its federalist and democratic experience. But it is not only Europe that needs more democracy and federalism. Without Europe, direct democracy in Switzerland is also becoming weaker and weaker. For this reason, the SP is committed to refining popular rights within Switzerland and, at the same time, to establishing and consolidating them on a European level, together with the other EU members. Thus, our EU membership will strengthen the people's rights in the long run. If Switzerland remains alone, it loses sovereignty; together with the other EU members, Switzerland gains more sovereignty. The demands of the SP: 1. the Federal Council must immediately reactivate the application for EU membership so that Brussels takes the Federal Council's strategic goal seriously. Switzerland could immediately participate in the shaping of the future institutions of the EU. Switzerland must not only profit from the pacification of Europe, but must itself contribute to the equalization of living opportunities throughout Europe and also assume global responsibility in and for Europe. The Federal Council must ensure that Switzerland prepares itself domestically for EU accession. To this end, the value-added tax must be raised and a decision must be taken to abolish the antisocial capitation payments for health insurance premiums. The reform of the government is to be advanced so that it will be able to participate in decision-making in EU bodies. 4. 4. the people's rights must be supplemented and refined at the federal level in such a way that they are strengthened by Switzerland's European integration. The focus is on the constructive referendum, the popular motion for transnational policy and a modified majority of the cantons. 5. The accompanying measures agreed upon in the Bilateral Agreements against wage dumping must be consistently enforced. 6. Public services must be coordinated at the European level. 17. youth: Supporting the younger generation for a good future for all. The economy has long since discovered the young generation as a new consumer target group and has since been relying on an ageist youth mania. The SP has a different vision of youth policy: An intergenerational equity that recognizes that the older generation has important needs and needs just as much as the youth is massively underrepresented in politics. A forward-looking youth policy does not pit the different generations against each other and takes into account the reality that today's youth are anything but homogeneous. The state has the task of creating opportunities for the self-realization of the young generation. The SP knows that the right to education and vocational training is very important for the future opportunities of young people. The demands of the SP: 1. since young people will be the most affected by the effects of current political decisions in a few years and decades without having a say in them, the active participation of young people in the decision-making process is essential. and passive voting age to 16 years. 2. the young generation must have a right to cultural development and realization. Therefore, a national impulse program for the promotion of regional and municipal youth culture initiatives must be developed and implemented. 3. To prevent a lack of prospects, unemployment, youth poverty, increasing individualization and the resulting social coldness in our country from leading to an increase in violence among young people, the counseling centers for young people are to be massively expanded. 4. political and social issues should be discussed in civics classes. It must therefore be strengthened. There must be no more schools without access to new technologies. 6. 6. the offer of school exchange programs between the different language regions must be improved, because these promote living together in Switzerland. 7. provide affordable and diverse housing for young people. 18. homosexuality: Equality for lesbians and gays instead of discrimination. Around five to ten percent of the Swiss population (i.e. around 350,000 to 700,000 people) are homosexual. Although society is increasingly supportive of other lifestyles, it remains difficult to live openly lesbian or gay. The taboo promotes homophobia. Coming out is a very drastic moment in the lives of lesbians and gay men. Exposing oneself in the family, at school, at work, in clubs, etc. takes courage and requires support. However, in school, in teaching and in youth groups, young people coming out are hardly supported. The youth suicide rate is significantly higher among lesbians and gay men than among heterosexual people of the same age. Openly living homosexuality often still means exposing oneself to discrimination and having to explain one's sexual orientation anew every day. The SP demands that lesbians and gays are not discriminated against and are treated as equal citizens. The SP fights homophobia and expects everyone else to do the same. The demands of the SP: 1. to ensure that lesbians and gays are treated equally as a matter of course. 2. a partnership law that is as close to marriage as possible must be implemented. In addition to mutual financial support, this law and in addition to inheritance claims civil rights aspects such as the choice of name or to regulate civil rights. There must be equal rights for partnerships with foreigners and the right to adoption. 3. the state must promote and financially support counseling and support measures for people coming out. 4. homosexuality should be addressed in schools in a value-neutral way. 5. the anti-racism article must include public appeals and the dissemination of ideologies that discriminate against persons or groups on the basis of their sexual orientation as punishable offenses. 19. security policy: More peace and security with less army. Military policy can only be justified within the framework of a comprehensive foreign, peace and security policy. The SP Switzerland focuses on civilian instruments of conflict prevention, humanitarian aid in the event of conflict, and post-conflict reconstruction. The Army still has the optics of the Cold War, except that today it has lost the enemy. In this logic, the Army produces idle time that consumes too much money and too many man-hours. The SP Switzerland therefore calls for a mission for the armed forces that is tailored to today's risks. The Swiss army is too big, it has the wrong mission and it costs too much money. These funds are lacking in other areas of society. The central risks for our country and our population in the future are of a non-military nature. Rather, they lie in global environmental degradation and in the dependence of modern societies on highly vulnerable technical systems. The SP Switzerland therefore advocates an army that meets the real security needs of our country. The demands of the SP: 1. switzerland must be committed to the safety of the people, human rights and democracy in the broadest sense. The focus must be on an army that intelligently implements a risk-based mission. The mission of the Swiss Armed Forces must focus on three aspects: Switzerland should participate in peace support operations of the international community. National defense readiness in the event of war must be reduced to the ten-year warning period. The area must be secured by air and border police. 3. Switzerland must commit itself to humanitarian and collective security beyond its national borders. 4 Switzerland must support the establishment of a system of collective security under the leadership of the UN. and the OSCE. It must not join NATO. Since universal conscription and conscription justice lead to an army that is far too large for a risk-based army mission, a volunteer model with 15,000 temporary soldiers and 45,000 reservists should be envisaged. However, a professional army in which soldiers spend their entire professional lives should be rejected. 6. The army must be guaranteed the resources necessary to fulfill its risk-based mission. Equipment requirements and costs must be derived from the Army mission and Army model. The current military budget of around 4.2 billion Swiss francs must be reduced to 2.5 billion francs. 20. migration: A humane and pragmatic policy instead of exclusion. As a typical immigration country, Switzerland has legislation that dates back to the 1930s and is at odds with the social and economic reality of Switzerland. The myth of over-foreigning led to a paranoid and bureaucratic policy that does not meet the demographic and economic needs of Switzerland. Harassing institutions such as the seasonal worker statute and the quota system led to tens of thousands of migrants becoming Sans-Papiers. The cantonal decision-making authority repeatedly leads to arbitrariness. Inhumane wage conditions and an irrational mistrust of the Swiss population towards the ""non-Swiss"" are the result of this migration policy. The draft for the new Aliens Act is a continuation of this unrealistic policy. Admission requirements target only an elite, forcing the less qualified into illegality. The principle of equal treatment with citizens from EU countries is violated, especially with regard to professional mobility, the right to settle, the renewal of short-term permits and family reunification. The Bilateral Treaty with the EU on the free movement of persons requires that EU citizens residing in Switzerland may no longer be discriminated against. Their residence permit depends only on the existence of a work permit, and they have the right of professional and geographical mobility and extended family reunification. Simultaneously with the entry into force of this treaty, a transitional period of twelve years began with preferential treatment for domestic workers, quota restrictions on work permits and measures against wage dumping. The SP wants a migration policy that is fair to migrants from non-EU countries, the economic interests of Switzerland and the migrants' countries of origin. Provided there is an employment contract and the employer commits to social standards, the immigration of citizens from non-EU countries is to be permitted. These people are then to be put on an equal footing with EU citizens. The SP adheres to the basic principle that Switzerland is an open and safe country for political refugees, but also for people who died before the war or fleeing violence in the private sphere. 1. a migration policy must be pursued in the short and medium term that ties the admission of persons from non-EU countries to criteria that only affect the companies (subordination to a CLA, direct financing of integration measures, etc.). 2 In future, a broadly composed federal commission, in cooperation with the cantons, must ensure that the companies comply with these obligations. 3. all persons employed in this way must - like EU citizens - be granted the right to family reunification. 4. the residence permit of spouses must be decoupled, and the validity of the residence permit may no longer remain tied to a shared household. 5. immigrant workers must receive the same support for professional and geographical mobility as local workers. 6 Integration measures must be jointly financed by the state, employers and employees. Migrants should be required to attend vocational counseling and language courses. Integration measures are urgently needed, especially for young people and women. 7. 7. passive and active voting rights for foreigners must be introduced, initially at the municipal and cantonal level. 8. naturalization should be regulated according to objective criteria, so that equal opportunities are guaranteed. The provisions shall facilitate naturalization for the second and third generations."
43320,200710,"Globalization - the ever closer interconnection of countries and peoples of the world - affects all countries and all areas of life. This closer integration holds great opportunities and is to be welcomed in principle. The SP notes, however, that the neoliberal offensive has succeeded in shaping globalization unilaterally in favor of the powerful and privileged, first and foremost the transnational corporations and financial firms. Instead of reducing poverty and strengthening environmental and political sustainability, the gap between rich and poor has widened, the environment continues to be shamelessly exploited despite all the lip service paid to it, and democratic structures in many countries of the South and East are weak or completely absent. This primarily affects women, children and young people. This kind of globalization is driving millions of people to flee their homes today. The SP is convinced that it was political decisions that drove globalization at the expense of the weakest. It is also up to policymakers to reshape globalization in a way that benefits everyone. Not only the economy, but also politics must be globalized in order to strengthen social justice, ecological sustainability and democracy, and finally overcome poverty. The inclusion of all parts of the world in equal political decision-making and the fair balance between North and South are more urgent than ever. The SP shows which instruments can be used to shape globalization in a social and ecological way for the benefit of all people: The positions of the SP: Switzerland must work for enforceable global institutions as well as universally valid agreements that are suitable for balancing the interests between strong rich and poor weaker countries. Multilateral regulations must have clear priority over bilateral agreements. Social globalization requires increased leadership from the UN. Switzerland should support the transformation of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) into a Council for Economic, Social and Environmental Security with the power to issue directives and take decisions. In global institutions such as the WTO, the UN, the Monetary Fund and the World Bank, institutional reforms are needed that aim at more transparency and democracy and help weaker states to gain more influence (capacity building). As announced, the WTO Doha trade round must become a development round. This is also essential in view of the UN Millennium Development Goal to halve the proportion of people living in absolute poverty and hunger by 2015. The World Trade Organization must no longer be an independent organization, but a structure linked to the United Nations. Their work must be integrated into the UN-led policy framework. Switzerland should advocate unilateral and unconditional concessions to the poorest states and provide them with concrete support in achieving minimum social and environmental standards. Institutional learning in the WTO must be significantly strengthened. The impact of WTO decisions on women, children, poverty and ecology, especially in developing countries, must be regularly evaluated and taken into account in new decisions. Social and environmental dumping must no longer be a competitive advantage in the world market. Multilateral regulations must set clear framework conditions for business with the aim of making the global economic order fairer, enforcing minimum social standards and effectively protecting the environment. Switzerland must work to ensure that the social provisions of the International Labor Organization and environmental protection provisions are also applied in trade law. Of particular importance are binding standards against the exploitation of women in the labor market. Switzerland should work to ensure that the corresponding provisions of the EU Directives on Equal Rights for Women and Men, the UN Convention against all Forms of Discrimination against Women and the resolutions of the UN World Conference on Women, in particular the recommendations of the ""Beijing Action Plan"", are implemented and further developed worldwide. Switzerland must work for a revision of the WTO agreement on agriculture in such a way that the right to food security is also guaranteed for the countries of the South. Switzerland should grant the 49 least developed countries full access to the Swiss agricultural market, relax rules of origin for this group of countries, and reduce tariff protection for processed agricultural products so that they can develop their own food industries. For development policy reasons, the WTO must grant developing countries the possibility of temporarily protecting newly emerging industries in a differentiated manner with trade-restrictive measures (including industrial tariffs). At the same time, the poorest states must be given preferential access to the markets of the rich states; asymmetrical market opening is needed for their industrial products. Since the GATS carries a major risk of liberalization, the SP Switzerland is committed to ensuring that the Federal Council and Parliament do not enter into any commitments in the GATS that could somehow jeopardize the public service worldwide. The GATS negotiations must not lead to any cuts in the public service! In addition, Switzerland must push for development policy safeguards in the GATS so that developing countries can build up their own service sectors and protect themselves against harmful practices by trans- and multilateral companies. Strong multilateral regulation of trade in services must ensure that public service is preserved, that development policy demands are respected, and that the weaker are effectively protected against the more powerful on the world market. Switzerland should advocate an amendment to the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property so that the countries of the South are given the right to shape their patent law in line with their level of economic development, sections of the population are always given access to low-cost medicines, in particular against AIDS, and that the patenting of life, including seeds, is excluded. In the event of financial crises, the private sector must also be held accountable. In the event of liquidity crises, it should be prevented from unilaterally withdrawing funds by means of credit lines. Likewise, as a beneficiary of the international financial system, it must share in the risks and should not leave losses solely to the public sector. The World Health Organization must be given back the independence it has lost in favor of economic interests and military-technocratic requirements. Abolish the unhealthy subordination links between the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding all health issues related to ionized radiation (minimizing the effects of Chernobyl, depleted uranium problem, etc.). Over one billion people live in absolute poverty. More people die from hunger and malnutrition than from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined. Hunger also claims about 1000 times more lives than all wars. Glaciers and polar ice are melting, and climate change is in full swing, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the environment, economy and social fabric worldwide. At the UN Millennium Summit in New York and the Sustainability Summit in Johannesburg, there was a consensus that the rich countries face a threatening future if business and politics do not respond to the global challenges, risks and downsides of globalization. The world can only become safer and more peaceful if the Millennium Development Goals - first and foremost, halving poverty by 2015 - protecting our environment and sharing scarce resources equitably are actually implemented. The world has become an interdependent system. Prosperity, security and democracy in Europe and Switzerland increasingly depend on global processes. Switzerland ranks high in the globalized world economy. Without massive investment in international solidarity and global policies to overcome poverty, increase social justice, and effectively mitigate climate change, Switzerland is putting its foreign policy credibility at risk and jeopardizing the basis of its own prosperity, security, and democracy in the long term. The SP therefore calls for a massive strengthening of development cooperation, a sustainable reduction in the international debt of the poorest countries, innovative instruments for financing development and greater coherence in foreign economic relations as a whole. The positions of the SP: Switzerland has to increase the public funds for development aid to 0.7% of the gross national income (GNI) by 2010 and to 1.0% by 2015 (status in 2006 and 2007 due to statistical tricks: 0.40%). Switzerland should contribute constructively to the international establishment of innovative instruments for development financing. There is a need for a kerosene and air ticket tax, and there is a need for a currency transaction tax on short-term speculative transactions, which could act as a steering instrument to stabilize international financial markets while providing additional funds to finance global needs. Switzerland's development cooperation should make a high-quality contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, strengthen good governance and democratic participation by civil society, and help reduce violence and promote peace. In particular, this includes programs that build on the supporting economic role of women and combat the socially entrenched discrimination and exploitation of women and children. Developing countries need to be freed from the legacy of over-indebtedness so that they can devote more resources to poverty reduction. Switzerland should advocate sustainable debt relief and a development policy that reduces developing countries' dependence on external sources of financing. The debt relief process should be designed in such a way that it promotes democratization and good governance for more social justice, peace and ecological responsibility in the countries concerned. The Federal Council should again advocate the creation of an international insolvency procedure that offers over-indebted countries protection against powerful creditors and guarantees their own ability to act. Switzerland should work constructively at international level to develop effective instruments to combat tax and capital flight, abandon the distinction between tax evasion and tax fraud and grant administrative assistance in cases of tax flight and tax evasion while safeguarding fundamental rights. Developing countries and countries in transition must be able to introduce or maintain capital account restrictions, at least temporarily. Switzerland should work within the World Bank to ensure that it acts in a results-oriented manner and reviews the effectiveness of its work through rigorous quality control and evaluation of activities based on the defined target system: achieving the Millennium Development Goals, in particular halving poverty by 2015, combating environmental degradation, implementing and further developing social and environmental standards, gender equality and combating corruption in the World Bank and the recipient countries. In order to achieve these goals, independent appeal bodies must also be established. Switzerland should participate in the implementation of the OECD proposals for an ecological tax reform in favor of sustainable development and poverty reduction. The World Bank's water privatization programs, which are geared more to the profits of the companies involved than to the basic provision of public goods, must be stopped. The World Bank must: democratize its governance structures, thereby giving developing countries equal influence; introduce an international insolvency procedure; find a fair solution to the problem of illegitimate debts accumulated by dictatorships; work for effective prevention of financial crises, in particular by reducing the risks arising from highly volatile international financial flows; and combat excessive tax competition. 11. Switzerland should work to ensure that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 12. Switzerland should work to ensure that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), when granting loans to developing countries, refrain from structural adjustment programs that force these countries into liberalization, privatization and budget cuts in the social sector. The long period of weak growth between 1990 and 2004 caused many problems for Switzerland: too high unemployment, too few contributions to social insurance, insufficient labor force integration of women. Despite rising productivity, domestic demand remained weak. Disposable incomes stagnated. The public sector increased the pressure to save money. The increased economic growth after 2004 must be sustained with an economic policy that is economically, socially and ecologically sustainable. Economic: Full employment is not possible without strong growth. Growth opportunities can be strengthened through innovation and by strengthening domestic demand. The purchasing power of the population is raised with the fight against the high price island Switzerland. The rights of consumers must be improved. The implementation of gender equality, especially with regard to wages, which are still differentiated by gender, has opened up further growth potential. Social: Financing social security requires growth in the wage bill. Equality demands can be better enforced. The distribution problems must be addressed more decisively: First and foremost, through a fairer distribution of productivity gains. After years of stagnating wage development, employees must receive a larger share, primarily in the form of higher wages. In the process, the increasingly excessive rip-offs by top managers are being combated. The wage gap is a time bomb for social peace in Switzerland. Ecological: Ecological restructuring can be combined with a growth policy and thus accelerated. A responsible growth policy must be linked to progress in the conservation of resources (energy, raw materials). The technical possibilities for this exist, especially in the energy sector. There is a lack of political will to intervene in a guiding way. Conversely, zero growth does not automatically bring more environmental quality, as evidenced by the stagnation of the past decade. The decisive factor is to combine the growth target with ecological goals. To be able to verify this sustainable development, we need other measures than gross domestic product (GDP). The SP Switzerland strives for higher economic growth that creates jobs, distributes the fruits of growth more fairly and is coupled with ecological transformation. The purchasing power of Swiss households must be strengthened in order to boost domestic demand. An economic policy that promotes the use of new environmental technologies, minimizes the use of resources and increases energy efficiency also promotes growth. The positions of the SP: 1. growth in the traditional sense of macroeconomic indicators such as GNP and GDP is an outdated, incoherent concept and, moreover, incompatible with the concept of sustainable development. Indicators must be defined that take into account the environmental and social aspects. The concept of differentiated growth needs to be introduced. The sustainability of economic development must be made verifiable with new measurement methods (e.g. with the easy-to-use ""Short Indicators of Sustainable Economic W elfare"" SISEW ). In terms of traditional metrics, economic growth of 2 - 3% per annum remains a key economic policy concern for the SP in the context of sustainable development. To strengthen domestic demand, the disposable income of private households must be increased. In addition to better wages and secure pensions, there needs to be relief for lower and middle incomes in terms of health insurance premiums. The fight against excessive prices and for a reduction in the cost of goods is also intended to strengthen the purchasing power of the population. Public spending is an important pillar of demand and employment. Their wages should be exemplary benchmarks for the private sector - with good wages across the board, moderation at the top and equal pay between men and women. The investment policy is intended to have a countercyclical effect. The state must make above-average investments in education, research and innovation, because they are the key drivers of growth. Women must be able to do more gainful employment. What is needed is a balance between family and career and working conditions that reflect equality. Men must also have and take advantage of the opportunity to become involved in family work. The right of consumers to information, transparency and representation in political processes must be guaranteed. Health protection, protection against deception and the right of associations to take legal action must be expanded. Consumer rights in the areas of product safety, warranty services, declaration obligations, insurance protection, depositor protection, right of purchase, etc. must be brought into line with the European level. In order to combat the high price island of Switzerland, parallel imports of patent-protected products from the European area should be permitted and technical barriers to trade should be eliminated through extensive recognition of the Cassis de Dijon principle. The salaries of the top managers of publicly traded companies are to be determined democratically and set at a range of no more than ten times the lowest salary in the company. More efficient energy use (production processes, renovations, thermal insulation) and the targeted promotion of alternative energies also trigger growth and employment impulses. Clear targets are needed to conserve natural resources. Unemployment is hard to bear for those affected and economically a waste of resources. There is a lack of political will to intervene. The high youth unemployment rate is particularly serious. If young people do not find a job after leaving school, this will cost us dearly in the long term. Tackling youth unemployment is a key concern. Employers must also be held accountable for this. Full employment also requires a redistribution of paid and unpaid work between the sexes. Methods to improve work sharing also include more part-time positions for men and women (namely in management positions), reducing weekly working hours and/or lifetime working hours. Excluding workers aged 55 and over from the labor process is economically short-sighted. In a few years, demographic trends will create a labor shortage. The premature involuntary exclusion from the labor force will take its revenge. The retirement age needs to be made more flexible in both directions. Those who can no longer work should be able to retire earlier under decent conditions. At the same time, working conditions for older employees must be improved so that they can also work longer. Structural change is leaving deep scars on the labor market. Jobs are no longer secure. Full employment is no longer recognized as a task by the business community. Professional demands are increasing. Completely new job profiles are emerging. The differences between the regions are becoming greater. In many cases, peripheral regions are struggling to keep pace. Locations are subject to strong competition. Small and medium-sized enterprises have a hard time financing their investments. Venture capital is expensive. In order to shape this structural change in a socially acceptable way, Switzerland needs an active education and research policy. Only with an excellently trained workforce can the Swiss economy maintain a technological edge on the global market. People whose vocational training is outdated or who lose their jobs must be helped to retrain and find work. Technological innovation thrives on the intensive transfer of knowledge from universities to industry. Good framework conditions are needed when setting up technology-oriented new companies. It makes sense to link innovation promotion directly to regional policy. The focus of technology policy should be environmental technologies in the broadest sense - innovations where a high societal ""return on investment"" is offset by too low a private-sector return on investment.... This is where the state comes in As a counterpart to the uncertainty of structural change, it is imperative to have the security of a well-developed unemployment insurance system. It must be able to guarantee those affected that the loss of work does not end in an economic disaster that segregates socially and makes it difficult to return to work. From the point of view of the SP, every woman and every man must have the opportunity to secure their livelihood with their own gainful employment. Full employment must once again become a declared goal of politics and the economy. A better distribution of paid and unpaid work also plays an important role in employment policy. The state must help ensure that young people enter the workforce. Older unemployed people must be given more opportunities on the labor market again - if only because of demographic trends. There must be an end to the wage pressure on wage earners and the simultaneous wage excesses on the carpet floors of large multinational companies. Economic structural change must not be blocked, it must be actively supported. This means first and foremost investing in people (better education, more integration) and in the environment (less consumption, better energy efficiency). We have to fight for that. With an education offensive and a structural adjustment fund, the SP wants to ensure that structural change is socially and regionally compatible. The positions of the SP: Every young person must be able to pursue an education after completing compulsory schooling. Those who do not find a job after completing their training must still be able to find a career. Above all, companies that do not train apprentices should be required to offer internships for people just starting out in their careers. Full employment cannot be achieved through wage dumping, insecure employment contracts or deteriorating working conditions. Simultaneously with the realization of the goal of full employment, the general validity of collective labor agreements must be extended. The world of work must modernize. Time off must become possible without losing one's job. Companies must develop programs to promote part-time work for men, especially in management positions. Likewise, companies must provide programs and framework conditions aimed at increasing the proportion of women in management positions. Otherwise, legal measures must be taken. Older employees must be able to reduce their workload without jeopardizing their retirement provision. Labor market measures of unemployment insurance, disability insurance and social assistance must be geared to permanent reintegration into the labor market. The period of unemployment is to be used for targeted vocational qualification. Wages must be living wages. This requires collective labor agreements with binding minimum wages in all sectors of the economy, especially in all sectors with precarious working conditions, e.g. transport, retail trade, cleaning, catering, agriculture. A Second Labor Market (e.g., employment programs) can be supported where there is proximity to the First Labor Market and a primary focus on integration. Under such conditions, temporary wage subsidies can be useful. Better education from preschool through higher education to lifelong learning is the best prerequisite for managing structural change. This requires more investment in education and more equal opportunities in access to education. All employed persons should have the right to paid training leave of at least five days per year. The increasingly expensive further training courses require financial assistance for trainees that is more targeted than tax deductions (further training vouchers). Ensure equal access to continuing education for women. Knowledge transfer between universities and industry must be massively intensified. A ""Fund for Innovation and Structural Adjustment"" is intended to support the difficult transition from research and development to production in newly emerging small enterprises. This can also achieve regional policy effects. The public financial sector (cantonal banks, cooperative banks, Postfinance) is to be strengthened as a counterpart to private-sector banks in order to ensure fair credit conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises in the long term. 5. regional policy, tourism and agriculture Sustainability as a success factor Regional policy to date has helped structurally weak areas to build up efficient basic infrastructures for the population and w orld economy. In the future, it will be a matter of focusing regional policy resources more on job preservation and creation. The state can promote the formation of innovative companies, their grouping in clusters and the better connection of structurally weak regions to economically strong centers. In many areas, tourism plays an important economic role. Tourism has been in transition for many years and faces intense international competition. For Swiss tourism, environmental sustainability must be a guiding principle. The state should use its subsidies to support structural change by facilitating restructuring for innovative companies, helping the industry with staff training and development, and forcing more cooperation in marketing. The necessary money is to be raised by abolishing the special VAT rate for overnight stays. The fight against the high price level in Switzerland relieves tourism businesses on the cost side. Tourism and agriculture can realize more joint projects in the mountain area, because both depend on sustainable development in the long term. Agriculture has a future in Switzerland as production agriculture. It has them if it consistently continues to focus on the quality of its products and the ecology of its production methods. It must convince consumers in Switzerland and, with the increasing opening of the market, more and more abroad that its products are better than those of its competitors. Producer prices must be brought to a level that is competitive in the EU. In addition to efficiency gains, the focus is on lower input costs by enabling parallel imports. (To ensure that productivity gains reach consumers, lower producer prices must not be absorbed by upstream and downstream industries). The relaxation of regulations for ecology and animal welfare would be a wrong move, as it would take the most important trump card out of the hands of Swiss agriculture. In addition to production, agriculture plays an important role in biodiversity and landscape conservation. In order for it to fulfill this role, it should be adequately compensated by the state with direct payments. The SP seeks a reorientation of regional policy in two directions: instruments and resources must be concentrated on the preservation and creation of jobs, and greater emphasis must be placed on the environmental compatibility of projects. The promotion of tourism must be first and foremost the promotion of innovation, education and training. And agriculture needs continued, socially responsible structural change, with a stronger focus on ecology and animal welfare. and a further gradual opening of the agricultural market. Agriculture is to play a greater role in ecological conversion (""from farmer to energy farmer""). High-quality products from Swiss agriculture have a chance on foreign markets - it must be seized. The positions of the SP: 1. swiss regional policy must consistently focus on innovation incentives . There is a need for better coordination of the cantons' economic promotion. Cantonal priorities in the establishment of new companies must be coordinated nationally. The instruments of economic development must avoid exacerbating tax competition between cantons. Existing companies must not be disadvantaged by excessive relief for newly established companies. A quality-oriented tourism policy requires further restructuring of the industry, the promotion of alternative environmentally friendly tourism projects, professionalization of management and more cooperation between tourism centers For the personnel employed in tourism, there is a need for a collective labor agreement that attracts well-qualified personnel through attractive working conditions, and an education and training offensive. The special VAT rate for accommodation services should be abolished. This frees up resources for targeted use of public funds. Structural change in agriculture must continue. It is socially acceptable, with about 3% plant closures per year. Reducing regulations at the expense of ecology and animal welfare is out of the question and would result in a reduction in direct payments. Within direct payments, there needs to be a shift from general to organic. The direct payment system should be based more on the ecological effects achieved rather than on standards met and thus also become an incentive system for special ecological performance. The shift from market support measures to direct payments linked to environmental conditions must continue. The Swiss agricultural market must be gradually opened up further. An agricultural agreement with the EU can become an opportunity for Swiss agriculture. The agreements within the framework of the WTO must not jeopardize the reforms for a socially acceptable structural change in Swiss agriculture. Switzerland has to commit itself to social and ecological standards in the W TO. 6 Transparency and Democracy in the Economy A New Approach to Co-determination in the Economy Switzerland has no actual co-determination of wage earners. The rights under the Participation Act are vanishingly small. In the supervisory bodies of the pension funds, employee representation is neutralized by the employers. More economic democracy serves to secure jobs. Employees have a fundamental interest in the long-term security of ""their"" company. Compared to top managers, their ability to change jobs and places of residence is significantly lower. In many cases, wage earners are existentially tied to the location and to a company. The consequential costs of plant closures are borne by the affected wage earners and society, but not by top managers. Even though only a quarter of the population owns shares, most wage earners are indirect shareholders through the securities held by the AHV and pension funds. It is also in the interest of wage earners to improve transparency in companies and to strengthen the rights of minority shareholders, e.g. in determining the wages of top managers. This is because the exorbitant salaries of top executives are not determined by a market, but by a small cartel of headhunters, interested managers and board members. The basic capitalist rule that the owner determines the company's policy no longer applies to many public companies because share ownership is fragmented. Here, salaried managers rule at the top, and in many cases there is a lack of balance between management and control. The SP must defend itself with all means against the new rip-off practice in the large multinational corporations. The rules protecting employees, but also minority shareholders of publicly traded companies, must be expanded. We need a new approach to genuine codetermination as well as more binding rules for corporate governance. Both processes need to be linked. The positions of the SP: In companies with more than 100 workplaces, co-determination must be introduced (new Works Constitution Act). In parallel, trade union rights must be strengthened and effective protection against dismissal for employee representatives must be established. Only representatives of wage earners are to be delegated to the supervisory bodies of BVG organizations (pension funds, foundations, collective foundations). The remuneration of top executives in publicly traded companies - management and members of the Board of Directors - must be commensurate with their performance and the development of the company and other salaries. A maximum range must be set between the highest and lowest wages in a company. As a rule, this should not exceed a factor of ten to one. The compensation of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board is to be determined by the owners of the companies at the Annual General Meeting and not in dependent compensation committees of the Board of Directors. Contractually agreed ""golden parachutes"" (severance payments) for company top executives are to be declared null and void if they exceed an annual salary. They create the wrong incentives. Transparency in wages and employment conditions is an important tool in the fight against discrimination. Public companies and companies closely associated with the public sector must guarantee the representation of both genders at the top of the company. Within ten years, both genders must be represented by at least 40%. Transparency also means the right to information about the strategic policy pursued by the company for the employees and for the consumers (where does the money of the sponsorship go, what are the working conditions of operating sites abroad, etc.). 7. finances and taxes For a future-oriented state budget and more tax justice Switzerland's government spending ratio (government spending as a share of GDP) rose in the 1990s, partly due to low growth and high unemployment. However, it is still low by international standards. An efficient state with high-quality infrastructures and services not only offers the population a real return on the taxes collected, but is also a trump card for the Swiss economy. Anyone who wants to reduce the state share and dismantle the state is acting in an anti-social and anti-economic manner. Ideologically motivated austerity policies are increasingly impairing the state's ability to act. The short-sighted focus on annual budget balancing prevents a forward-looking fiscal policy that creates the conditions for growth through investment and stabilizes spending in times of crisis. A fair and transparent tax system is the prerequisite for people's trust in the state. Allowing tax loopholes undermines tax morality. All income and assets must be fully recorded. All persons should be taxed according to their economic capacity - regardless of marital status, household form, type of residence, whether they are employers or wage earners. The more comprehensive the tax base, the lower the tax rates can be. Switzerland has a comparatively low tax burden. Only Australia, Japan, the USA and Ireland had lower fiscal ratios (taxes and social security contributions as a proportion of gross domestic product) in 2003. The companies pay below-average taxes compared to the rest of Europe. In Switzerland, the incomes of wage earners are taxed disproportionately. There are glaring inequities between workers. Those who - like many top managers - receive part of their salary in the form of shares and options are systematically given preference. Small savers must pay full tax on the income from their savings accounts. Private capital gains escape taxation. The abolition of inheritance tax for direct descendants created a new tax privilege that is particularly advantageous for wealthy individuals. The loss of tax revenue is often compensated with higher fees and tariffs. Fees place the greatest burden on lower and middle incomes. The cantonal differences in the tax burden are too high. Even within a canton, the tax burden varies by up to one third. The fueled tax competition between the cantons harms everyone. The SP is committed to the goal of a healthy state budget: Government spending and revenues must be balanced in the long term and in line with the economic cycle. Wise fiscal policy strengthens the purchasing power of the population when demand is weak and sets aside reserves for the future in a dynamic economic phase. This contributes more to a balanced budget in the long term than tax cuts for the wealthy, which do not even lead to higher investment. Tax cuts for the rich and stock owners prevent a sustainable budget balance. Taxation in Switzerland must become fairer: with a better orientation towards economic performance, with fewer tax exemptions for individual population groups and with a converging rather than diverging regional tax burden. The positions of the SP: The SP is committed to a strong state that ensures social justice, actively supports ecological restructuring and creates the conditions for long-term growth with a financial budget that is capable of action. The budget balance at the federal level is to be achieved by 2010. The prerequisite for this is economic growth of at least 1.5 percent. Without that, the federal government's structural deficit cannot be eliminated. Spending is to be managed through clear priorities. All tasks, subsidies and tax benefits are to be periodically reviewed for their appropriateness. An efficient state serves the population best. Reforms are needed in administration, in the tendering system and in subsidies. Fiscal policy measures have different effects on gender. This must be made visible in budgets, financial plans and savings programs. A taxation independent of civil status eliminates the unequal treatment of married and cohabiting couples and at the same time favors a partnership-based division of gainful employment. Every type of income - whether wages, pensions, inheritance, dividends, capital gains - must be recorded and taxed according to the taxpayer's economic capacity. Tax benefits for income from shareholdings are not eligible. With the introduction of an inheritance and gift tax at the federal level, tax fairness can be strengthened. The desirable simplification in the tax system should lead to more transparency and fewer loopholes in income taxes and less hassle in VAT, without making VAT more anti-social. A reform of the value-added tax cannot be had without a reduced rate for everyday goods and without socially justified tax exemptions (e.g. rents). In addition to the CO 2 levy, a new approach to ecological tax reform is needed. The incentive levies are to be largely neutral in terms of state quotas. The distinction between tax evasion and tax fraud must be eliminated. Tax evasion should be combated in the same way as tax fraud. Tax bullshit is tax bullshit. Competition between cantons must be limited to a tolerable level. Harmful tax avoidance tourism, which only wealthy, mobile individuals can afford, should no longer be worthwhile. The SP is therefore calling for material tax harmonization between the cantons. Public service means the provision of basic goods and services to the population, in which the state has a responsibility. A large proportion of citizens are dependent on this solidarity community of the state, which is, however, coming under increasing pressure. The tasks of the public sector will increase in the coming years, and its financial resources will become scarcer. Cantons and municipalities lose their political leeway. However, a reduction in government tasks causes a redistribution from the bottom to the top and hits economically weaker people in particular. The liberalization and privatization demands of neoliberal circles put additional pressure on public service providers and lead to competition at the expense of employees, consumers and the environment. The SP is committed to a well-developed, democratically legitimized and controlled public service, which is available to the entire population in all regions at the respective best recognized state of the art and under the same conditions. The public service and its services are of central importance to the SP for social, societal, political and ecological reasons. Public service should contribute to equal opportunities and justice by enabling all people to be part of a society and its structures as well as part of its culture. For this reason, public services cannot and must not be geared to the market alone. They require solidarity-based financing, provided by all members of a society and dependent on their respective economic performance. The positions of the SP: The Confederation and the Cantons shall guarantee the equal treatment of the population in the provision of public goods and services on economically and socially acceptable terms, in particular in education, health, energy, postal services, telecommunications, water and public transport access. The SP rejects further privatization and liberalization. Infrastructures belong in the ownership of the public sector. The performance of the public service must be exemplary in terms of innovation, ecology, service design, working conditions (via GAV), training and further education, proven apprenticeship system, organization of the companies and equality between women and men. Jobs with guaranteed minimum wages must be offered to less qualified people or people with a disability. The privatization of individual profitable areas must be prevented and public services must be subject to solidarity-based financing. These include subsidies, cross-funding, asset- and income-based funding, or concession fees. The collective bargaining unit under the ""stamp system"" stands for solidarity between the different parts of the country. Private providers must be obliged to comply with the working conditions customary in the industry or to conclude a collective bargaining agreement. For companies with a public concession, there must be a training obligation. Competition should be based on quality and prices, not on wage and social dumping. The public sector must formulate an active ownership strategy for all its companies. A proportion of at least 40% women must be ensured in the top management bodies (boards of directors). The SP rejects a further reduction of the monopoly limit at Swiss Post or even a privatization of Swiss Post. The universal service defined in the Postal Act with an attractive post office network must be maintained as a public postal service. Providers who do not offer universal postal services are to be required to pay into a compensation fund that will enable Swiss Post to better finance the maintenance of its post office network. Payment transactions must remain part of the universal service provided by the Post. A post office bank shall be created as a public law institution or as a special law joint stock company. As the universal service licensee, Swisscom must develop a strategy for its home market that guarantees investment in cutting-edge telecommunications technologies with a promising future. All households must be guaranteed high-performance and affordable access to telephony, Internet, TV and video on demand via the fixed network. Access to the latest information technologies must be ensured for all residents - especially the elderly and people living in peripheral regions. Women and men should be able to choose freely and naturally between family and career. They should be supported by politics and society to the best of their ability. This also makes economic sense, because the economy cannot do without the many female workers. Families provide great financial and cultural services to society across generations. At the same time, they incur high costs, for example by paying for the children's education. The equalization of these benefits and burdens is insufficiently organized in Switzerland. More and more families are struggling financially. Single-parent families are particularly vulnerable to poverty. Children have even become a poverty risk in Switzerland. Childcare services that meet demand, are of good quality and affordable for all parents, such as crèches and day schools, are important cornerstones for reconciling family and career and for a socially stable society of tomorrow. It's time for a v erything. The compatibility of family and career should become a matter of course. The SP is committed to a social environment that improves equal opportunities for children and young people. Families need better financial support. The risk of poverty among single-parent families must be reduced with targeted measures. Children must not be a risk of poverty in a rich country like Switzerland. Children depend on the protection of society to safeguard their well-being. The positions of the SP: There needs to be a good quality, needs-based, affordable offer of family and school daycare places in crèches, daycare families and day schools for all parents throughout Switzerland. The timetables of schools and companies must be harmonized. With a constitutional mandate, this requirement is to be declared binding and implemented. Businesses benefit from cribs. They are to participate in the financing of childcare places above a certain size. Switzerland needs fair and efficiently organized child allowances. The principle of ""one child, one allowance"" must be implemented. Families must be relieved with a free health insurance for children within the framework of the popular initiative for a social unified health insurance. Family supplementary benefits for low-income families must be introduced to target poverty. Instead of tax deductions, tax credits should be introduced. This will provide targeted relief for middle- and lower-income families. Alimony regulations must be harmonized throughout Switzerland. Pension equalization in the event of divorce must be improved in favor of women, because current practice puts women at a disadvantage. Paid parental leave is needed, as well as paid time off to care for sick children. Fathers want and need to be involved in the responsibility for raising children and family work. Therefore, working time models are needed that support a redistribution of gainful employment and family work. Parent education and parent counseling services should be promoted and offered throughout the country. Families need affordable housing that is child-friendly, as well as living environments that are child-friendly. More funding for integration programs for children and parents from immigrant families is essential. The foster care system needs to be professionalized. This will require a revision of the foster child ordinance or the creation of a separate law. Switzerland has a good but expensive healthcare system. It guarantees the entire population access to high-quality medical care. The healthcare sector also has an economic significance: over 50 billion Swiss francs are turned over each year, and it provides thousands of people with a job and many with an educational opportunity. Switzerland is the only country in Europe to have an unsocial per capita premium for compulsory health insurance, which is particularly burdensome for families and those on low and medium incomes. The much vaunted competition among insurers and providers at the time of the introduction of the Health Insurance Act has not had a positive effect on cost control and cost containment. Instead of focusing on cost management, the insurers have intensively pursued risk selection and established low-cost insurers. Costs are rising every year. Civic prescriptions rely on more competition and cuts in the basic benefits catalog to contain costs. This adds to the burden on private households and encourages Z weiklassenm edicine. The SP fights for high-quality basic medical and nursing care to which all parts of the population have access. The SP is oriented towards a model in which the health care system, as an important area of public service, in particular primary care, is subject to democratic control, can be managed efficiently and effectively and has a social financing system. The principles of equal treatment and solidarity enshrined in the Health Insurance Act must be maintained. The cost trend in the healthcare system must be curbed by cost-control measures and measures to reduce the price of medicines. The SP fundamentally rejects a relaxation of the territorial principle under the motto ""more competition - lower prices"". The SP could only agree to the inclusion of service providers in neighboring countries if this would improve the quality of basic care in a region and ensure fair pay and working conditions for the staff concerned. The positions of the SP: The unsocial capitation premiums must be replaced by income- and wealth-related premiums. Competition among health insurers, which is harmful to the insured, must be ended. The SP therefore supports the popular initiative ""for a social health insurance fund"". Federal and cantonal contributions to premium reductions may not be reduced. On the contrary, the cantons must design premium reductions in such a way that households strained by the capitation premium are actually relieved. A package of measures is needed to curb the cost trend: Overcapacities must be reduced; the planning and control competencies of the public sector must be strengthened, both in the outpatient and inpatient sectors; private hospitals must not be subsidized with public funds. They are to be included in hospital planning only if services need to be purchased there to ensure basic care; The purchase of high-tech medical equipment in the outpatient and inpatient areas must be approved by the canton concerned; Introduction of global budgeting in the outpatient area. Coordinated planning of cutting-edge medicine by the cantons must finally be implemented, otherwise the federal government will have to take over this task. The Confederation, the cantons and the private sector shall contribute financially and in terms of resources to a policy of disease prevention, in particular those diseases that arise in the workplace or may arise as a consequence of occupational activity. The increasing number of specialists must be slowed down. On the other hand, family medicine needs to be promoted and upgraded so that there is no underuse in certain regions. This requires targeted measures: Family doctor models are to be offered by the insurers nationwide; integrated care networks with budget and cost responsibility and measures for quality assurance are to be promoted. No further costs should be shifted from basic insurance to private households. The tax-funded portion must be increased. Complementary medicine should be included in the basic benefits catalog of the health insurance funds, and research in this area should be supported and accelerated. Drug prices must be lowered with a bundle of measures. The cantons ensure a sufficient and good quality offer of assistance and care at home. The free choice of physician should be preserved and the basic benefits catalog must not be dismantled. Measures in the area of prevention, health promotion and health education are to be initiated or supported at all levels. The Confederation and the cantons must establish clear regulations for uniform verifiable quality standards for treatment and care in all long-term care, whether inpatient or outpatient. Based on uniform quality criteria, adequate funding is ensured. The wages in the nursing homes must correspond to those of the employees in the public hospitals. Since there is a serious shortage of well-trained professionals in the healthcare sector, especially in the nursing professions, training conditions must become more attractive for young people. In addition, women in particular need targeted support measures for sensible career and career planning. Long-term sick people, who are often poorly protected, must be given better protection with a nationally regulated daily sickness benefit insurance. The state must ensure by law that all employees in Switzerland have daily allowance insurance that covers at least 80% of their gross salary in the event of illness. Human genetic material must not be patented. Many people in Switzerland continue to fall through the social security net. An unchecked attack by bourgeois circles on this network aims to puncture the insurance principle by reducing benefits and to steer the development of social security back in the direction of a welfare state. Social welfare spending is on the rise. But that's not all. Recipients of social security benefits are stigmatized as potential abusers, especially in the case of disability insurance and social assistance, which is intended to legitimize an elaborate control apparatus. This development is taking place in an environment of tax giveaways to the rich and corporations, as well as the declared goal of the Federal Council to stabilize the state quota by 2015, which is to be achieved with savings in the billions in various areas of responsibility. The large-scale social insurance construction site shows the following: The new edition of the 11th AHV revision attacks the mixed index, which cuts pensions. The retirement age for women is to be raised to 65. For a small number of the population, an early retirement benefit, enshrined in the Supplementary Benefits Act, is provided. The major AHV revision is already planned for the next legislative period. It is announced as a consolidation bill, which means that further cuts in services are to be feared. Not only the first but also the second pillar is under fire again. The conversion rate is to be cut much faster and even more than decided in the 1st BVG revision. As a result, pensions under the mandatory occupational pension scheme will fall even more sharply and rapidly. The 5th IV revision provides for a strengthening of the long-standing principle of integration before pension, a massive reduction in new pensions and drastic measures to cut benefits. The IV -funding bill is available. However, the link with the 5th material IV revision has not yet been realized politically, which means that the pressure on IV finances and the reduction of benefits will be maintained. The Federal Council has announced the revision of the Accident Insurance Act, including proposals to reduce the benefits of mandatory accident insurance in various respects. The Federal Council must increase contributions based on the financial situation of unemployment insurance and the financing provisions set forth in the law. It will also have to review performance adjustments at the same time, which will mean nothing other than performance reductions. Switzerland does not have a national framework law on social assistance. The Swiss Conference for Social Welfare draws up recommendations (SKOS guidelines) for the attention of the social authorities in the municipalities and cities. In some cantons they are declared binding, in others not. Rising welfare spending will increase pressure to adjust these guidelines again and reduce welfare payments. The SP is committed to a dense social security network and social justice. In principle, the insurance principle should be strengthened, which is why the SP cannot support cuts in this area. If necessary, the financing of AHV and IV should be regulated via additional wage and/or value-added tax percentages. A further increase in the retirement age for women without a socially designed flexibilization of the retirement age in the AHV insurance system is out of the question for the SP. It therefore supports the trade unions' popular initiative ""for a flexible AHV age"". Switzerland is one of the richest countries in the world and can afford a good social policy. Whether it is possible to grow old with dignity and material security is a political decision, as is standing up for the rights of people with disabilities or improving the living conditions of people with low or no income. The SP fights to ensure that everyone can count on the solidarity of society. Poverty affects different groups of the population: Children, youth, families, disabled and elderly people. Poverty reduction must be coordinated. The positions of the SP: No increase in the pension age and no reduction in AHV benefits, but strengthening of the first pillar. For many people, the AHV is the most important income in old age. Pensions must continue to be adjusted every two years in line with inflation and real wage trends (mixed index). The flexible retirement age of 62 for all, anchored in the AHV system and without pension cuts, must finally be realized and must not be at the expense of women. The SP Switzerland supports the popular initiative of the trade unions ""For a flexible AHV -age"". The massive reduction in benefits in the 5th IV revision must be rejected. Access to IV pensions must continue to be guaranteed in the future; the concept of invalidity must not be applied in a discriminatory manner. The Social Democrats are opposed to any shift towards supplementary benefits, from benefits that are now part of basic insurance (AHV, IV, etc.). Business and the public sector must assume their responsibility in implementing the principle of integration before retirement in a binding manner by providing more jobs than today for people with disabilities. The financial reorganization of the disability insurance must be implemented urgently and quickly; it must be linked to the 5th IV revision. No further reduction in the conversion rate for the mandatory occupational pension plan (BVG). The coordination deduction is to be abolished, or at least substantially reduced. 504 Unemployment insurance contributions should be levied on the entire earned income, as is the case with the AHV. No reduction in SKOS guidelines. A national framework law for social assistance is needed. A national action plan is needed to combat poverty. In particular, more must be done to promote the professional and social (re)integration of young welfare recipients. The subsistence level must be exempt from taxation at all levels of government. To enable older people to live in their own homes for as long as possible, sufficient, comprehensive and high-quality home help and care services with secure funding must be provided. The eligibility requirements for care credits in the AHV must be improved. The current ones do not do justice in any way to the services provided by family caregivers. People with disabilities need better access to buildings, public transport and infrastructure for their quality of life. Barriers to training in housing and employment must be removed. The Disability Equality Act must be applied and implemented. The SP Switzerland must take care of certain categories that are particularly vulnerable due to insufficient social security (migrants, persons without gainful employment, persons working in the household, elderly persons with few years of contributions, certain international civil servants, etc.). New models are to be developed for crediting social insurance contributions for voluntary work and voluntary work that can be proven to have been carried out (similar to the care credits for AHV). The social time card should serve as a basis in this context and be promoted. Switzerland is still far from achieving equality between women and men. Conspicuous indicators of the still serious discrimination against women are the unjustifiable wage differences, where women earn up to 20% less than men for work of equal value, the segregation on the labor market, the weak representation of women in state or economic management bodies and the socially uninsurable additional work of women in the non-remunerated areas of our society. However, all men who want a fairer distribution of rights and duties between women and men, both in the professional and family world, and who (want to) live accordingly, also suffer from this discrimination. The constitutional principle of equality, the right of women to vote and to be elected, and the Gender Equality Act are not enough to bring real gender equality closer. Progress in equality is evident in many areas. But this is not enough. A profound rethinking is needed in Switzerland, which will make the culture of an equal society possible in our society. The Social Democratic Party has been working for this for years and will continue to do so with perseverance and tenacity. Equality between women and men is one of the central socio-political goals of the Social Democratic Party. In all policy areas, the issue of the differential impact of our laws, regulations and customs on gender must be reviewed and, where necessary, non-discriminatory solutions sought. The positions of the SP: The equality of women and men enshrined in the constitution and laws must be enforced at all levels. The weak points of the Gender Equality Act that emerged from the evaluation presented in February 2006 must be corrected (introduction of the right to sue authorities and the right to sue for performance, expansion of sanctions for non-compliance, expansion of the easing of the burden of proof and protection against dismissal). The gender equality aspect must be taken into account when working on all political issues (gender mainstreaming). A national research program on ""Gender Equality"" is to be carried out so that the gender-specific impact of individual regulations or customs can be identified, their specific discrimination potential recorded and effective measures proposed on the basis of reliable data. The federally-owned companies and public administrations are called upon to lead the way at the federal, cantonal and municipal levels as good examples of ""companies"" that take gender equality seriously and promote it. When awarding public contracts (submissions) at federal, cantonal and municipal level, care must be taken to ensure that the criterion of ""family-friendliness"" is also taken into account. A paternity leave of at least 2 weeks, starting in the public administrations at federal, cantonal and municipal level and in the private sector, is to be introduced. In the long term, parental leave is to be demanded. In public administrations at the federal, cantonal and municipal levels, a gender quota in management functions must be introduced that takes into account both part-time and gender quotas. Generally applicable guidelines for the crediting of proven key competencies in the classification regarding wages (e.g. in the case of reentrants) are to be developed.

For the first time in the history of mankind, a significant proportion of the 60 to 80 year olds in Western countries can experience this period in good health, and this is referred to as the third phase of life. The needs of people in this phase of life have changed and continue to change. These women and men want to have a say in the necessary social, political and economic adjustments. Policymakers also have to take this into account. The shaping of life after employment is often influenced by decisions made in the period before. For example, finding an apartment in which one can stay as long as possible in old age. E.g. to be able to organize the professional activity in such a way that health does not suffer. A good ageing policy is forward-looking and starts where people begin to think about and prepare for their later and later stages of life. In old-age policy, the SP seeks solutions based on solidarity, dialogue and equal interaction between the generations. It wants citizens of all ages to have the opportunity to have a say, develop their strengths and use them in an age-appropriate manner. Elderly people should be able to live their lives to the best of their ability in a self-determined manner. The SP resolutely fights against all obvious and hidden discrimination on the basis of age and fights for the dignity of people until death. The new third phase of life brings society many experienced people who are healthy and active. This opportunity must be used for the benefit of the people concerned and society. The positions of the SP: Cooperation between generations must be given high priority in all areas of life, society, politics and the world of work. The public sector supports projects and endeavors that enable and promote this. Prevention for a healthy old age in all areas of life . Work, housing and traffic planning must always be measured against the preservation of health. Independence must be preserved for as long as possible. Housing must be designed so that the elderly can remain in their homes. Services must be designed accordingly. Buildings for public traffic must also be designed to be easily accessible for the elderly. The informal care and support services, which are predominantly provided by women free of charge, would have to be recorded statistically and compared with the costs of care. Healthy ageing implies the possibility to work in an age-appropriate manner in the later phases of working life. The SP calls for career planning and career counseling also for employees over 50, the design of workplaces that take into account the needs of older workers, and working time models that allow gainful employment until the official retirement age for as many as possible. Lifelong learning also means age-appropriate learning. The corresponding offer must be accessible and affordable for all. Sufficient counseling services must be provided to assist people in the various stages of aging according to their needs. The autonomy of the elderly must also be guaranteed by care at home and social care centers, support services, neighborhood services, as well as by a sufficient number of beds in nursing homes, which must provide high quality services by trained personnel. The families of dependent elderly persons, whose members become ""natural caregivers"" of their loved ones, must be given the support necessary to carry out this role with dignity. Their role must be recognized socially and economically. 14. youth For a future with prospects Adolescents are in a delicate developmental process. Unemployment is poison to a young adult's self-esteem. For the social integration of young people, regular training and work is central. The path to an apprenticeship and a profession must be open to all boys. If necessary, the state must also ensure a sufficient supply of apprenticeships. Expanding the scholarship system would not only increase equal opportunities, but also ease the burden on the labor market, which would make it much easier for weaker performers in particular to enter the workforce. The state must take action to break the gender bias in occupational fields. If no more is done for the timely social integration of young people, more and more young people will fall into welfare dependency and de facto poverty unchecked. The consequential costs of this increasing professional and social non-integration of young people are incalculable. In the sense of a preventive welfare state, social welfare dependency as well as the frequent and increasing indebtedness of young adults must be prevented with preventive work and direct support programs. Young people are not firewood for the economy. Apprentices and young wage earners must not be abused as cheap labor. They are entitled to high-quality training, appropriate remuneration and at least 7 weeks' vacation. An expansion of Sunday and night work by young people is not acceptable under any circumstances. The protection of minors must be regulated to a sufficient extent by law. The vast majority of students, as well as a not insignificant proportion of pupils, vocational baccalaureate students and even apprentices, still have to work alongside their education (often at very low wages) in order to be able to live reasonably free of financial worries according to their needs. Far ahead of health insurance premiums and even ahead of living expenses, spending on housing is the heaviest burden in the budgets of many young adults. The housing shortage, particularly in large cities, is known to be one of the main reasons why rents in Switzerland are completely excessive by international standards. As a result, many young adults accept long commutes to their ""training sites."" There is clearly too little cheap w orkspace for young adults today. This must change urgently! On a cultural level, it is incredibly important to offer young people maximum opportunities for development. Youth culture should be promoted more strongly, especially where it is practiced by young people themselves. A society can only call itself truly democratic when all its members are involved in the political decision-making process. Political participation is not a concession, but a right. Children and young people need to learn democratic participation from an early age. Decisions that directly affect them must not be made over their heads. Their voice must be taken seriously at all political levels. The position of youth commissions must be strengthened. The political commitment of young people is to be supported and should not be hindered. The SP is committed to a society that recognizes young people as equal members. Young adults have the right to a framework in education and work that is adapted to their needs and specific circumstances. The political participation of young people is a right that must be promoted with appropriate measures. The positions of the SP: The state and industry must work together to ensure a sufficient number of apprenticeships. Each and every school leaver has the right to further education. Cross-industry vocational training funds must be established so that an adequate supply of apprenticeships can finally be created. No degree without employment! Everyone who has completed their training must be given the opportunity to enter the world of work. If necessary, the state must ensure full employment through investment, work programs and its own ventures. The scholarship system must be massively expanded - also in the non-university sector - and harmonized at the national level. The number of young people dependent on social welfare must be significantly reduced. The federal government must encourage the cantons to do more to combat poverty and exclusion among young adults through support programs. Social benefits must be paid in full until the youth could be reintegrated. The indebtedness of young people must be counteracted. Various measures can be considered: increased prevention, more restrictive conditions for consumer loans, free and professional debt counseling throughout the country. Young people must not be misused as cheap labor for wage dumping purposes. The measures for the protection of minors in the Labor Code must therefore be expanded and not dismantled. In addition, the number of mandatory vacation weeks for apprentices should be increased to seven. Drug use by young people must be massively reduced. Prevention work and educational measures are to be promoted. There needs to be an extension of the ban on alcohol and tobacco advertising. Decriminalization of cannabis use and preparatory acts must be combined with high taxation and clear production specifications (THC content). The housing situation, which is particularly precarious for young adults, especially in the big cities, is to be counteracted by the state-supported construction of new student and apprentice housing and dormitories. The state must sensitize young people to gender equality issues. In particular, measures must be taken against horizontal and vertical segregation in the world of work. A longer stay in another language region should be part of the compulsory program for every student during elementary school. Association and open youth work must be expanded and better supported. Non-commercial youth culture must be supported both financially and with an adequate government supply of affordable spaces. The teaching of political education must be an integral part of all curricula and more time must be given to it in the school day. The voting age must be lowered to 16 at all political levels . The participation rights of youths and young adults must be strengthened at all levels. Co-determination rights of student and faculty councils must be enshrined in law; likewise, the democratization of universities must be systematically advanced. Youth development must be coordinated at the national level in a framework law. Switzerland's position in the world has changed fundamentally in the course of globalization. National borders have become very permeable, and the speed and frequency of cross-border exchanges have assumed enormous proportions and continue to increase. Public goods such as peace, an intact environment, social justice and human security for all can only be provided with the significant participation of the supranational level. The Confederation ""shall contribute in particular to the alleviation of need and poverty in the world, to respect for human rights and the promotion of democracy, to peaceful coexistence among peoples, and to the preservation of the natural foundations of life."" This is how Article 54 of the Swiss Federal Constitution describes the objectives of foreign policy. For the SP, it is clear that this vision must not fall victim to bourgeois austerity mania and an unrealistic retro discourse. Rather, it must be implemented consistently. It is not only a matter of international solidarity, but also in Switzerland's own interest to open up and participate at all levels according to its weight and values and to help decide where public goods are provided and to contribute to solving all problems at the level where they belong. The positions of the SP: Switzerland must break up its encrusted structures and pursue a much more active and coherent foreign policy. All foreign relations - including those of the Swiss financial center and Swiss multinationals - must be consistent with the five objectives of Swiss foreign policy set out in the Constitution, or at least must not run counter to them. The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) must be given a much stronger position in the coordination of foreign policy and ensure coherence and efficiency. It must not be the case that 50 federal offices from seven departments - as is the case today - conduct 50 different foreign policies of Switzerland. The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (seco), the army and the intelligence services must not be above foreign policy either, but must be at its service. With its own contributions and an active foreign policy, Switzerland must do everything in its power to ensure that the UN Millennium Development Goals, namely the halving of poverty by 2015, are actually achieved. It is right that governments have committed to measurable targets and can be held accountable to them. The SP will also measure the Swiss government against its promises. Switzerland should do much more than it is doing today to massively increase international funding to combat the HIV/AIDS problem and significantly increase its contribution. Switzerland's human rights policy must be strengthened. A human rights report is needed every legislative term, in which accountability is given and new goals are formulated. The Confederation must participate in the establishment of a Swiss human rights institution in accordance with UN criteria. In addition, the Federal Council must finally present a coherent concept on the role of business in strengthening human rights and anchoring human rights standards in international trade agreements. The promotion of democracy - the broadest possible participation of society - must occupy a central place in Swiss foreign, development and peace policy. Democracy is the form of resolving and regulating conflicts without violence and ensuring a peaceful society. Good governance must be promoted and all forms of corruption and abuse of power must be combated. Switzerland must pursue an active disarmament and arms control policy. Its commitment to curbing the all-too-easy availability of small arms and light weapons - today's true weapons of mass destruction - is to be significantly strengthened. The nuclear-weapon states must be reminded of the disarmament pledge they made in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Every effort must be made to ensure that the ban on anti-personnel mines under international law is actually observed and that mines already laid are removed as quickly as possible. Switzerland must do its utmost, in close cooperation with like-minded states, first and foremost the EU, to ensure that the USA can be integrated into global climate protection policy as part of a proactive approach. In addition, strategic partnerships are needed with countries such as China, South Africa, Brazil, and India to help them develop sustainable energy strategies and ensure their participation in efforts to reduce emissions. With the opening policy votes in 2005 (Schengen/Dublin and extension of the free movement of persons), the Swiss people once again gave a clear rejection to isolationism and isolationism and at the same time affirmed that opening and internal reforms, namely to strengthen social security, cannot be separated. In terms of European policy, this leaves only two options open: The continuation of the bilateral path and the start of accession negotiations with the European Union with the goal of EU accession. With its new Europe Platform, the SP has weighed up both options and analyzed the pros and cons. The SP comes to a clear conclusion: bilateralism has reached its limits. It undermines the sovereignty of Switzerland. The static treaties are associated with the compulsion to continuously adapt to dynamic legal developments in the EU without being able to have a say in these developments. In many areas, Switzerland refrains from negotiating with the EU at all and adapts its laws by way of what it euphemistically calls ""autonomous"" implementation. For the SP Switzerland, there is only one conclusion: Only the rapid initiation of accession negotiations offers a perspective to overcome the growing dependence on Brussels decisions, which is inevitably linked to the bilateral path and ""autonomous"" follow-up, and to regain sovereignty for Switzerland. The advantages of joining the EU are obvious: Switzerland can have a say where the key decisions are made. Switzerland is working in solidarity to solve the major problems of today and tomorrow, which no longer stop at any border. The EU is Europe's great work of peace. It is the bearer of the European social model, which must be defended against attacks. The emergence of a Union-wide legal area greatly enhances the quality of life of European citizens. Switzerland can only benefit from EU accession in terms of equality policy. The Swiss export industry benefits from additional export opportunities. Consumer protection is strengthened. The ecological transformation of the energy supply receives sustainable impetus. Economic growth in Switzerland is being stimulated and the high price island of Switzerland is coming under pressure. If Switzerland joins the EU, this does not mean the end of politics, but the beginning of new opportunities for influence. The SP is not calling for Switzerland to join the EU because the EU is paradise on earth. Rather, the SP calls for Switzerland's accession to the EU because the EU already has a very strong impact on Switzerland and it is crucial that Switzerland is able to push through concrete political demands within the EU, such as combating the existing democratic deficit, widespread unemployment, insecurity and attacks on the public service. The positions of the SP: The Federal Council must quickly reactivate the application for EU membership and swiftly initiate accession negotiations. Only by joining the EU can Switzerland regain its sovereignty and have a say in decisions that are already crucial for it. The Federal Council must ensure that Switzerland prepares itself domestically for EU accession. Reform of the government and parliament must be advanced so that they can effectively participate in decision-making in EU bodies. The people's rights are to be supplemented and refined at the federal level in such a way that they are strengthened by Switzerland's European integration; the introduction of the Constructive Referendum, the European Initiative and the E uropam otion are in the foreground. The Federal Council should provide for four exceptions in the mandate for accession negotiations to the EU: no adoption of the euro for the time being, no reduction of the letter monopoly below 100 grams, no opening of the last mile, no complete opening of the s tromm arket. Switzerland should conclude a socially and ecologically designed agricultural agreement with the EU. This also brings Switzerland closer to the EU. The SP can agree to further bilateral agreements if they remove accession hurdles and noticeably facilitate and simplify relations with the EU for the people of Switzerland. The Federal Council must do everything in its power to ensure that Switzerland does not remain a high-price island vis-à-vis the EU. It should unilaterally introduce the Cassis de Dijon principle with as few exceptions as possible and allow regional patent exhaustion and parallel imports. The anti-competitive attitude of the economy at the expense of consumers must no longer dominate politics in Bern! The accompanying measures agreed upon in the Bilateral Agreements to combat wage dumping must be consistently enforced and expanded if necessary. The nationwide basic supply of the population with high-quality public services must remain guaranteed at a price that is affordable for all. Rapprochement with the EU and EU accession must be designed in such a way that a high standard of public service is guaranteed. Peace and international security are challenged by economic and social threats, including poverty, infectious diseases, and environmental degradation, as well as by conventional forms of threat, both interstate and intrastate, or terrorism and transnational forms of organized crime. Globalization has broadened the view from the world of states to people and their concrete rights and needs. The strict separation of inside and outside no longer fits our time. The military-centric, national territory-oriented approach is outdated. For the SP, it is clear that it is no longer a matter of state security, but of human security. And it is impossible for Switzerland to achieve peace, democracy and sustainable development on its own. These goals have become indivisible. It concerns us when millions of people suffer from hunger, violence and the violation of human rights. This is also because Switzerland has become more dependent and more vulnerable to events that take place in practically any place on the globe due to its increasingly dense network of relationships. The positions of the SP: Switzerland's commitment to peacebuilding must be significantly expanded. Switzerland should contribute much more to conflict prevention, violence reduction and humanitarian assistance in the event of conflict, and to reconciliation and post-conflict reconstruction than it does today. The Swiss army is far too big, it has the wrong mission and it costs too much money. It must be radically downsized and transformed so that its mission responds to today's risks. The goal of defending Swiss territory against an organized aggressor has become largely obsolete. The attempt to employ the Army in homeland security instead is wrong and must be stopped. A heavily disarmed and reconfigured army can make important contributions to peacebuilding and peace support in regions where the state monopoly on the use of force has collapsed and the civilian population is terrorized. Within the framework of a UN mandate and a concept of cooperative security based on violence reduction, democratization, development and peacebuilding, armed Swiss troops can and should also contribute to stabilizing and containing violence. With due regard for conscription justice, conscription leads to an army that is far too large for a risk-based army mission. Compulsory military service must be abolished and recruitment must be ensured within the framework of a volunteer model. Switzerland should contribute at all levels to the establishment of a system of collective security under the leadership of the UN and the OSCE. It must not join NATO. Switzerland must continue to resolutely fight the idea of pre-emptive war propagated by the USA and must work within the UN to ensure that the ban on the use of force, as laid down in the UN Charter, is not weakened. The right to self-defense must not be a pretext for waging wars like those in Iraq in 2003 or Afghanistan in 2001. Terrorism - an extreme form of criminal violence - must be fought with all vigor - but with respect for international law. The proliferation of nuclear weapons must also not be combated by military means, but only through international law. Switzerland should work within the UN to ensure that crimes against humanity and violations of the laws of war are systematically judged and tried by the International Criminal Court. As a preventive measure under international law, the Security Council should make use of its power to refer such cases to the International Criminal Court as soon as a conflict comes to a head. The principle that serious crimes must not go unpunished must be Switzerland should work to ensure that the UN, with the broad participation of stakeholders and civil society organizations, develops standards on how to manage natural resources in countries that have survived conflict or are at risk of conflict. In its peace work, the SP Switzerland is committed to involving women in conflict areas in the peace process. Switzerland must not support measures that strengthen patriarchal forms of rule. In all military conflicts and in the building of post-war societies, women provide a reasonably functioning civil society. Women should therefore be included in all decision-making processes at all levels, as clearly defined by the UN Security Council in its Resolution 1325. Switzerland should continue and strengthen its peacebuilding initiatives in individual conflict regions such as the Middle East (Geneva Initiative), the Balkans, the Caucasus, Central Asia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Indonesia (Aceh), Angola, Zimbabwe, the Great Lakes region, Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico, working closely with multilateral organizations and civil society organizations. In post-conflict societies, Switzerland should advocate a systematic approach to dealing with the past so that the truth comes to light and reconciliation becomes possible. This requires that verified and officially recognized facts are available and widely communicated; the harm suffered by victims is acknowledged; and perpetrators are removed from government and administration. In doing so, Switzerland must also acknowledge its involvement in injustices committed - including in the case of apartheid South Africa. Switzerland should not participate in the business with death and renounce war material exports. Instead of profiting from the suffering of war victims, Switzerland should make its know-how available to the world for peace. Security is a basic need of all and indivisible. Ensuring security is one of the core tasks of the state. It affects almost all policy areas. Security is ensured by a well-developed social security system that can be financed in the long term, a comprehensive education system, high-quality jobs for all, an effective integration policy, an intact environment and ecologically sustainable development, in short: a solidarity-based policy aimed at reducing violence, promoting peace and justice, both internally and externally. This general preventive, long-term view forms the foundation of a social democratic policy of internal security. In addition to these structural prerequisites of internal security, specific measures are needed to ensure that all people can live together in public and private spaces without violence. Violence and crime are found in every society. Fighting them is the task of every proper state. The SP is concerned about the current tendency to undermine democratic control and the rule of law in police actions under the guise of alleged or real threats to internal security (terrorism, hooliganism, etc.). Of particular concern are the increased use of coercive police measures to prevent crime (including preventive detention!) and certain extensions of the powers to collect and disclose personal data, which are sensitive from the point of view of data protection. For the SP, it is essential that the state's monopoly on the use of force remains intact. The police must regain ground against the army and private security services. In the core area of internal security, private security services have no more business than the army, which is desperately seeking employment opportunities. The police must have sufficient personnel and financial resources and provide their public service close to the citizens. In addition to the police, urban and neighborhood planning is needed to prevent the creation of ghettos, as well as targeted measures to reduce the propensity to violence in society and partnerships. In Switzerland, one in five women experiences physical or sexual violence in a couple relationship; worldwide, gender-based violence is the leading cause of death among 16- to 44-year-old women. The problem of domestic violence, which also affects men and children, must be addressed with a mix of repressive and preventive measures. The positions of the SP: Maintaining public safety in cities, neighborhoods and villages must be and remain a task of the police as a public service. This task must not be left to private security companies or citizens' groups, nor must it be assigned to the army. The army's various attempts to usurp more and more internal security tasks must be stopped. The police must be in a position, both in terms of personnel and finances, to provide a high-quality public service. The police should get closer to the citizens. This calls for permanently staffed neighborhood posts and community police forces with well-trained personnel and an organization that can respond quickly to calls and tips from the public. The various groups of the population should be adequately represented in the police force. The proportion of women must be increased with appropriate measures and persons with migration experience must be employed. This is done by opening police stations to holders of B and C residence permits, following the example of certain cantonal administrations that pursue a targeted policy of equal opportunities and social mixing. At all levels, legal foundations must be created for independent control and complaints bodies that monitor compliance with the legal framework in police work and take measures to protect citizens from arbitrary measures and abuses by police bodies. The control and complaints body must be free of charge, have access to all documents and be authorized to question police officers. Public spaces - neighborhoods, structures, plazas and underpasses - are to be designed so that everyone feels comfortable and safe. Intelligent planning should ensure that urban neighborhoods and villages are culturally and socially mixed and that local structures and networks of social relationships can develop well. Women, children and men must be protected against domestic violence. The police need greater powers to intervene (removal of the perpetrator from their home and surroundings for a certain period of time), sufficient support for the victim through counseling centers and emergency reception, accompaniment and support for the perpetrator as well as information, awareness-raising and prevention work. In order to contain and prevent youth violence and juvenile delinquency, there is a need for increased cooperation between the police, youth ombudsman's office, school social work, the education sector and guardianship bodies, and integrating measures at all levels. All agencies involved must have sufficient human and financial resources. There is a need for more (school) social workers, specially trained street workers and training and further education for teachers and parents in dealing with youth violence. Violent extremism and all forms of hate propaganda must be increasingly countered through an effective mix of repressive and preventive measures. As the FedPol's annual homeland security reports show, violent acts with a right-wing extremist background in particular have increased in recent years, and skinheads specifically use the Internet and right-wing extremist music to target young people in particular. Through integration projects and street work, but also through repressive measures such as entry bans for foreign bandleaders and checking song lyrics for violations of the racism penal norm, more action must be taken against skinhead concerts and other forms of right-wing extremist propaganda. In the armed forces, too, a consistently implemented concept of internal leadership must ensure that there is no place for extremist attitudes of any kind and for hate propaganda. Safety must also remain guaranteed in public transport. Well-trained train attendants are to be reintroduced on all trains. Railroad police must work professionally and must not touch the state's monopoly on the use of force. Any video surveillance in public spaces requires a legal regulation that clarifies data protection issues in particular. The all too easy availability of cutting and firearms in Switzerland must be significantly restricted with the aim of preventing violence and suicide, and the weapons law must be massively tightened. Weapons that are no longer used must be collected and scrapped, and all remaining weapons that are still in working order must be marked and registered. The acquisition, possession and carrying of weapons must be made significantly more difficult (proof of need). 11. all army weapons, including assault rifles, pistols and ammunition, must be stored in the barracks and may no longer be returned home. Today's energy supply is not designed for sustainability and security. Most of the energy is consumed by motorized transport, for heating and for water heating. We burn about 80% of our total energy needs in the form of fossil and therefore non-renewable energy. The new renewable energies - wood, solar, biomass, geothermal, wind - cover only a share of 1.5% of total energy consumption. However, their potentials show annual growth rates of 50 to 100%, both in terms of heat and electricity production. Huge potentials also lie dormant in energy efficiency, as well as in the building sector. A Minergie building requires less than half the total energy of a conventional building. With heat pumps, geothermal or solar energy, we are moving towards a zero-energy house. In the view of the SP, the fastest possible nuclear phase-out is necessary for both safety and supply reasons. The full supply from renewable energies must be promoted with the appropriate political framework. This is also indispensable for climate policy reasons. The large potential of domestic geothermal energy and the import of wind energy, for example, are sufficient to cover the demand in the long term. Electricity generation from biomass can cover about10% of Switzerland's consumption, based on 2004 consumption. A sustainable energy strategy also includes the promotion of energy efficiency and measures to reduce consumption. A boost in innovation in renewable energies and efficiency programs is economically interesting and creates many times more jobs than the operation of nuclear power plants. The positions of the SP: Renewable energies - water, wood, sun, biomass, geothermal energy, wind - are to be consistently promoted with the goal of a long-term and decentralized full supply in the electricity and energy sector and independence from fossil energy sources. We demand binding measures for the reduction of electricity consumption with a clear target value as well as a regular reporting obligation with regard to the degree of implementation. Up to 30% of electricity can be saved with best appliances (A class) and renovations. We therefore call for the enforcement of the energy label for appliances, the inclusion of further appliances in the energy label, the switch to the best appliances, licensing restrictions or bans where necessary (especially electric heaters and electric air conditioners), and efficiency programs of the local electricity companies. The enormous energy-saving potential in the building sector must be consistently exploited and promoted. Both for new buildings and for building renovations, at least the Minergie standard must be stipulated as the norm. We call for measures to reduce standby losses at the technical and awareness levels. According to estimates, these amount to more than 5% of the total e lectricity consumption. Hydropower can be moderately increased by modernizing old turbines and commissioning revitalized small hydropower plants. The expansion of hydropower must be carried out according to ecological criteria and in strict compliance with residual water regulations. The geothermal power plant in Basel, using a process known as deep heat mining, is the first commercial introduction of a new type of power generation. The development of deep geothermal energy is to be promoted in all major cities and municipalities in Switzerland. We call for a targeted expansion of wind energy in Switzerland. However, wind turbines must not be built in nature reserves and not against the will of the local population. The import of wind energy from abroad is to be greatly expanded and secured with contracts. The SP calls for the introduction of risk-based liability insurance for all forms of energy production, especially nuclear plants, the abandonment of operating extensions and the gradual decommissioning of all old reactors in Switzerland. No more public money should be spent on nuclear technologies (nuclear fission and nuclear fusion). Monitor that NPP operators accumulate sufficient financial resources for decommissioning of power plants and waste management. The siting decision for a final repository for high-level radioactive waste must not be made until the construction of new nuclear power plants in Switzerland is ruled out and the further generation of nuclear waste is limited in time. The innovative ""Energy Switzerland"" program must be provided with the necessary human and financial resources in the long term. As the central infrastructure of the public service, the electricity grid belongs to the public sector. The SP is fundamentally opposed to opening up the electricity market. The Swiss parliament is in the midst of debating the new Electricity Supply Act, the revised Electricity Act and the Energy Act. The SP can at most support a compromise with the following key points: opening of the Swiss electricity market only for large customers (over 100 MWh) and no full market opening without an optional referendum (2012). The planned national grid company for the electricity industry must be owned by the public sector with a clear majority. This is the only way to ensure that network maintenance and thus security of supply are not neglected for reasons of profitability. Ecology is not simply nature conservation. Ecology is the prerequisite for our survival. Economic prosperity is only possible in the long term in an intact environment, and economy must therefore be subordinate to ecology, not vice versa. The preservation of natural resources makes an important contribution to Switzerland's prosperity. Managing the environment and resources based on waste or not on sustainability is a threat to humans and animals and has negative impacts on climate, health and the delicate ecological balance. The people most affected by the increasing environmental damage are those in the countries of the South. The UN estimates that 18 million environmental refugees are already on the run in Africa alone - for example, in search of water sources. Their water cycles have been destroyed, among other things, by the high energy consumption of industrialized countries. Estimates suggest that climate change and other environmental pressures will increase the number of environmental refugees to 150 million by 2050. The SP is committed to an intact environment and the protection of livelihoods - both nationally and internationally. There is no way around the fulfillment of international obligations (e.g. Kyoto Protocol). This requires, among other things, investments in energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energies. In addition to protecting our natural resources of water, air and soil, environmental policy also includes investing in sustainable economic growth. The economy can learn from nature. It shows us how valuable raw materials can be extracted from natural resources. Environmental investments trigger a huge potential for follow-on investments and create jobs. The federal government, for example, takes more in taxes with ""Energy Switzerland"" than it spends on the program itself. Environmental policy must be prevention-oriented. Preventing floods and other disasters makes more social and economic sense than taking expensive measures after the fact. The positions of the SP: Natural resources such as soil, water and air must be specifically protected. This also includes consistent species protection. For social as well as economic reasons, environmental policy must be primarily geared to prevention. Consequently, the focus must be on damage prevention and on the resources needed to achieve this. The polluter-pays principle in the environmental sector is to be continued and expanded as a central measure. The ""subsidization"" of the annual environmental pollution of around 9.7 billion Swiss francs by the general public must be consistently passed on to the polluters. We demand incentive taxes and a renunciation of so-called ""voluntary"" measures. The obligations under the Kyoto Protocol are to be implemented with binding measures (CO 2 levy). The reduction of climate gases must be achieved primarily domestically. A consistent and legally anchored climate policy until 2050 is needed. Emissions from air traffic must be included in the CO 2 emissions reduction program. An international kerosene tax is needed. Emissions of nitrogen oxides, ammonia, methane, nitrous oxide and particulate matter must be massively reduced. Limit values must be consistently complied with. The release of genetically modified organisms must be prohibited. The ban on genetically modified foods must be strictly controlled. Living organisms or parts thereof may not be patented. Genetic resources must be freely available for moral, social and societal reasons. The right of appeal of associations must be preserved in its substance. Environmental impact assessments must be conducted and enforcement of environmental law must be consistently implemented. Noise makes you sick. Therefore, the necessary noise protection investments along roads and railroad lines must be made as quickly as possible. 85 to 90 % of all traffic jams occur in the agglomerations. They restrict mobility, endanger the health of the population, damage the environment, impair the quality of housing, life and location, and inhibit the economic opportunities of agglomerations. On the other hand, three quarters of all car trips are shorter than 10 kilometers and could in many cases be replaced by walking and cycling. For this changeover to succeed, safe and attractive offers are needed, as well as the necessary sensitization within politics and among the population. Without appropriate measures, the increase in private motorized transport will lead to even more noise and air pollution in and around the core cities and in the agglomerations and will endanger the health and safety of people and animals. The SP Switzerland is committed to a sustainable transport policy that meets the needs of people and the environment. The interests of all people should be taken into account equally, especially those of children and elderly people or people with reduced mobility. The SP also calls for a fundamental change in behavior in the area of mobility and mobility demands. The steady increase in motorized individual transport must be slowed down in the sense of a long-term rethink. Measures must also be taken in the area of freight transport to curb road transportation. This is a necessity to increase human and animal safety, promote climate protection and quality of life, and prevent further destruction of the landscape as well as the environment. When it comes to w ater transport, the demand - also and especially in domestic transport - is: ""Rail for goods!"" The positions of the SP: In order to maintain the dense public transport network, which is unique in the world, at a high level and, especially in the peripheral regions, to expand it in line with demand and, if necessary, to supplement it in the evening with call bus systems, the funds required to maintain and expand the infrastructure (rail, bus, streetcar) must be earmarked for the long term. In particular, the system of night buses should be promoted. Separation into infrastructure and operations should be avoided. The mobility needs of disabled people must be taken into account. Means of transport are to be planned or converted accordingly to be handicapped accessible. Switzerland must take a leading role in the protection of the Alps. The Alpine Convention must be ratified and the Alpine transit exchange must be realized as soon as possible - in cooperation with the surrounding Alpine countries. Transport policy must be designed in such a way that it minimizes particulate matter pollution, CO 2 emissions and exposure to all other harmful substances, and promotes climate protection. The successful modal shift policy in north-south traffic must be continued. The same applies to domestic transport: ""Rail for goods! The funds earmarked for transport financing must be prioritized for public transport, walking and cycling. Dedicated road funds are to be used for funding. We call for pilot projects with road pricing to test whether the intended steering effects can be achieved. Any expansion of the national road network may only be carried out on the basis of a new network decision, which must be approved by the people. The SP supports the creation of long-term agglomeration programs. In order to strengthen public transport and pedestrian and bicycle traffic in particular, early coordination with spatial planning is required at all levels. We demand better access to public transport stops, the elimination of dangerous spots on the road network and measures to increase safety for pedestrians and cyclists. Children have a right to traffic-free spaces and a safe route to school. The safety needs of women in particular must be taken into account. Stations and underpasses must be well lit. Each train is accompanied by a train crew. We call for a road safety policy based on a comprehensive safety philosophy (Vision Zero) that strives for road traffic without deaths and serious injuries. The training of motorized road users must be geared to this goal, as well as to the goal of driving in the most environmentally friendly way possible. In the case of heavy traffic, controls on working hours, maximum loads, compliance with technical equipment regulations, maximum speeds and the ban on driving at night and on Sundays must be stepped up. Additional heavy traffic control centers are to be established. Soil is an indispensable basis of life for humans, animals and plants, which must also be available to future generations. However, our use of soil as a resource is not sustainable. Soil consumption in Switzerland is currently around 11 ha per day or 1 m 2 per second, with an increasing trend, and is almost exclusively at the expense of agricultural land. Moreover, spatial planning is often understood one-sidedly as pure location promotion in interregional competition. This is especially true for public-intensive facilities such as shopping centers or sports stadiums, which in many cases are realized without prior investigations of the needs and behavior of the affected population and users. This jeopardizes the long-term security of everyday supply and leads to high subsequent investments by the public sector. Especially in densely populated agglomerations, spatial planning is a central instrument that must be used with the greatest care. Agglomerations are the reality of life for a majority of the Swiss population. Public transport as well as pedestrian and bicycle traffic are particularly important in agglomerations and must be promoted in the view of theSP. However, individual motorized traffic continues to increase as a result of road construction projects such as tunnels or freeway feeder roads. This leads to undesirable additional traffic and an increased burden on public spaces and the environment. The Swiss Social Democratic Party (SP Schweiz) therefore calls for the economical and careful use of land, based on sustainability and ecological criteria. It is committed to the principle of strict separation of construction and non-construction areas and opposes the mixing of these zones. The increasing urban sprawl and sealing of the soil must be stopped. The positions of the SP: Public spaces shall be designed so that they are safe for use by all segments of the population at all times. The needs of women, children and the elderly must be given special consideration. Equal consideration of the sexes must become a matter of course at all levels, both in the training of the professionals involved and in implementation. Spatial planning and structure plans must be more strongly oriented toward agglomerations. An agglomeration policy is needed that plans beyond municipal, cantonal and national borders. Cooperation between all levels must be intensified. Planning in the agglomerations must be coordinated and networked by central institutions at the federal and cantonal levels. This applies in particular to housing construction, company settlements, transport planning and infrastructure construction. The federal government needs coordinating instruments for quality management and controlling in order to check the national, cantonal and regional spatial planning measures for their effects. There is a need for coordination of settlement development and traffic/trail planning. Pedestrian and bicycle traffic as well as strategies for traffic calming and local speed limits are to be promoted in a targeted manner financially and structurally in the agglomeration policy of the federal government and the cantons. The dispersed development of settlements, which leads to low-density developments that cannot be accessed rationally by public transport, is to be replaced by denser building. Brownfields should be used before new land is built up. In Switzerland, unused industrial and commercial sites the size of the city of Geneva lie fallow. Buildings that no longer serve their purpose or cannot be put to good use or repurposed should be deconstructed. Spatial planning and energy issues must be considered in direct connection. Land use planning policies must be designed to support sustainable energy and climate goals. Cantonal, agglomeration and regional planning should closely coordinate settlement and mobility development and, in addition to qualitative and quantitative aspects, also include the energy relevance of developments. The media play a decisive role in controlling the powerful and shaping the opinions and will of those entitled to vote and elect. They must guarantee the diversity of opinion and independence that are indispensable for a direct democracy. Since the media markets alone are not capable of creating a public sphere that is compatible with democracy, state regulation is needed. These also affect the press, where a decades-long process of concentration has led to monopoly-like conditions in large parts of the country. Today, multimedia monopolization is widespread, with a monopoly newspaper, local radio and regional TV station all in the same hand. The SP is convinced that a diversity of journalistic offerings and competition between different, independent media in all parts of the country and in all language regions must exist and be promoted. In the electronic media sector, SRG continues to play a special role as a public service company with its regional-language radio and TV programs. It is also an important element for the regional and linguistic cohesion of the country. Private radio and TV stations are also to be increasingly integrated into the public service with performance contracts. The monopolization of the press must be countered with targeted state support for the press. The positions of the SP: An integrated media policy encompassing all genres (press, radio, TV, online) must ensure media diversity at all levels of government. SRG must be strengthened as a provider of a high-quality and comprehensively understood public service. This also serves national cohesion. SRG's tasks also include providing attractive programming for the Swiss abroad. In order to keep up with the powerful foreign competition, the SRG must be kept open to all development opportunities, especially in the area of technologies (""new media""), audience development (new forms of programming) and corporate development (cooperations). If a regional radio or TV station has proven that it fulfills a public service mission, it can be supported with fees. The mass media of the public service also have a cultural mandate. For this reason, Swiss and European cultural activities are to be given special prominence in its programs. Targeted press subsidies support and encourage competition among regional monopoly papers as well as newspapers and publications of organizations that contribute to the diversity of opinion formation. Gender equality must be consistently considered in terms of supply, role, presentation, design and use options. The inclusion of minorities with special journalistic needs (e.g. foreigners residing in Switzerland or people with disabilities) must be promoted and institutionalized. It must be ensured that digital online communication, which is becoming increasingly relevant in terms of journalism, is accessible to the entire population and can be used by everyone. Open source offerings in particular are to be promoted. Children should be familiarized with media use and the various media offerings at an early stage in schools. The goal should be in particular the active, critical and stereotypical images questioning approach to the media. On the other hand, the media must be encouraged to establish rules of professional conduct to limit violent and filthy depictions, especially when the media are easily accessible to children and young people. The increasing digitization of information means that telecommunications and mass communications are distributed via the same channels. The access of public programs to the distribution channels must therefore be protected. Depictions of arbitrary and/or degrading violence to human dignity outside a context necessary for information must be condemned and made inaccessible to young people during broadcasting hours customary for families. In a future-oriented democratic society, the fields of education, science and research are of extraordinary importance for the further development of all areas of life and the community. A good education policy is also the best economic policy: Switzerland has practically only its ""gray matter"" to meet the major economic challenges. Its trump cards are its innovative strength and job creation. It is therefore important to make the best possible use of them. However, the policy does not take this circumstance adequately into account. Education spending by the federal government, cantons and municipalities has virtually stagnated in recent years, even though the number of trainees has increased. The Swiss school system, with its structures and procedures, also leads to inequalities. There is a strong correlation between social background and school performance or who can attend college. The purely economic focus on performance and efficiency is already shaping elementary school teaching and is also increasingly influencing research and science. However, it is precisely the humanities and social sciences, which are designed for the long term, that play an important role at the interface between technology and society. The right to education and further education is a central social democratic demand The SP therefore demands that equal opportunities, individual support and integration be given top priority in the Swiss education system. This requires the most comprehensive and harmonized steps possible throughout Switzerland with regard to better and more permeable access to education, especially for disadvantaged social groups. The SP is also committed to equal opportunities in the various educational pathways, including vocational training. Education and research must not be reduced to economic usability, but must serve people and society as a whole. A one-sided focus on research areas that pursue purely economic interests should be rejected. The positions of the SP: We demand an education system that focuses on equal opportunities at all levels of education and in all areas of education and is permeable. Education spending at all levels of government must be increased significantly. Public elementary school is the most important institution of social integration. We oppose government funding of private school options. We demand the integration of kindergarten into elementary school, block times and day schools, two foreign languages in elementary school - the first must be a national language - as well as the definition of educational goals at the end of the 2nd, 6th and 9th school year. The federal government's subsidiary legislative competence must be exercised consistently if it becomes apparent that the cantons' coordination efforts are insufficient. Pupils, students and all other persons in the process of education and training should have rights of co-determination and participation. The vocational training system with its combination of school-based learning and in-company practice must be promoted and kept attractive for school leavers. The supply of apprenticeships must be increased. We demand an apprenticeship policy based on the motto: No graduation without a connection. This also includes free vocational and career counseling. Measures must also be taken to promote gender-neutral career choices. The federal government must exercise its constitutional authority in the area of continuing education. Lifelong learning is to be promoted by the federal government, cantons and employers through low-threshold access and awareness-raising measures. Illetrism, in particular, is to be combated with targeted promotion and reception measures. Priority setting and coordination at the university level are to be advanced with the aim of promoting quality. In selected areas, the aim is to achieve top performance in Europe and worldwide. Special attention must be paid to the promotion of young talent. Gender studies must be integrated into the individual scientific fields and a Swiss competence center for gender studies must be established. Tuition fees must not be increased and should be abolished in the longer term. There is a need for nationally standardized scholarships at a much higher level as well as material harmonization via minimum standards. The transfer of knowledge between universities and industry must be intensified. At the same time, the freedom of teaching and research must be protected from interference by the economy. To ensure this general interest, the financing of state research institutes and universities must be transparent and independent of profitability targets. 12. the Confederation should be given a genuine department for education and research. Culture in general and art in particular are part of our lives, shaping our being and making us critical, independent thinkers. Art draws attention to contradictions in action and thought, initiates developments, accompanies them or comments on them. The value of culture to a society goes far beyond the material value of works of art. Art is not just a commodity and therefore not a product that must obey exclusively the mechanisms of the market. The state must take regulatory measures and guarantee the framework conditions for artistic creation. Only in this way can the fundamental right of artistic freedom be exercised. The SP is committed to the UNESCO concept of culture. ""Culture, in its broadest sense, can be considered as the totality of the unique spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional aspects that characterize a society or social group. This includes not only art and literature, but also ways of life, fundamental human rights, value systems, traditions and beliefs. ""*) The SP is committed to a culture and artistic creation that on the one hand promotes identity and a sense of belonging, and on the other hand enables an open and critical discussion of Switzerland, both at home and abroad. Art should also take on the role of the court jester, who depicts the ruling conditions in an unusual way with impunity. Artists should be allowed to be critical without fear of being punished by funding cuts. Culture should convey tolerance, integrate, create interest and understanding for other people and ways of life. *) Definition of culture of the 2nd World Conference on Cultural Policy of UNESCO, 1982. The positions of the SP: Artistic freedom is a positive value and must be at the center of our country's understanding of art and actively promoted. Freedom of art requires freedom of expression and vice versa. Cultural promotion should take into account, reflect and promote the cultural and linguistic diversity of the country. The promotion of culture also includes international exchange. The area of pension provision and labor law in relation to artists must be regulated in a binding manner. Appropriate social and labor law frameworks are needed. The existing gaps in special legislation must be closed. Cultural creativity and cultural assets are of great economic benefit. Culture as an economic factor must therefore be taken into account in political and social discussions and promoted accordingly. Preservation of cultural heritage, protection of works and values of culture shall be promoted. In particular, audiovisual sources such as photography, film, video or sound are to be given importance. Access to museums, theater and dance performances, cinemas, etc. must be possible throughout the country and for all people living in Switzerland at affordable prices. The holdings of libraries, archives, museums and collections are to be made accessible in such a way that they can also be accessed via the Internet. Access to culture also means cultural education and further education as well as arts education. This applies to all population groups and must be encouraged as early as school. This includes access to audiovisual documents and promotion of skills such as media use. We call for fixed book prices throughout Switzerland and consistent promotion of reading. Pro Helvetia's autonomy must be preserved, especially when it comes to defining its strategy. Pro Helvetia should function as a national, highly professional cultural hub and be equipped with sufficient human and financial resources. The SP calls for a coordinated public museum policy. There needs to be openness to new forms of exhibitions and events that satisfy the demands of different audiences. Independent, high-quality film production, which is characterized by linguistic and cultural diversity, requires continuous public funding with appropriate budgets. 26. integration policy Integration as a social opportunity The most important obstacle to the integration of migrants is discriminatory behavior by part of the native population. There are numerous reasons for the population's distrust of foreigners: the most important is the passivity of the authorities in the face of denigration campaigns against them. On the other hand, it is clear that the adoption of discriminatory laws in the field of rights granted to certain foreign persons but not to others, as well as the drafting of extremely harsh and unrealistic legal texts concerning migrants, will also cause the population to think like the state, that is, migration will be seen as a problem that must be strictly regulated, rather than an opportunity for our society. Integration is based on reciprocity. Restrictive laws, which sometimes even violate the law on foreigners, increase the population's distrust of migrants. The alarmist and stigmatizing attitude of certain xenophobic circles creates a climate of fear towards these people. This fear on the part of the host population manifests itself in rejection, which hinders the integration process or even makes it impossible. The trigger for fear and intolerance is ignorance. To be accepted, you have to know each other. This can be done in a number of ways. To promote mutual understanding, it is not enough to rely on the good will of the various parties. Fundamental approaches such as intercultural, interreligious and social dialogue must be institutionalized. The SP believes that the state has a role to play and that it is its responsibility to implement an integration policy that first and foremost takes into account the facts of immigration. At stake is equal opportunity for access to social and economic resources. Integration is a dynamic, reciprocal and multilateral process that promotes responsible social behavior in individuals and allows them to act actively and constructively. Integration is thus a prerequisite for the harmonious coexistence of different communities. The integration goal concerns ordinary people as well as the upper cadres employed by multinational companies and their families. Integration is an ongoing process and must not be limited to a one-time, one-off action. It depends on the professional and social development of each individual, but also on the fundamental changes in modern society. First and foremost, it is about recognizing the other person from the beginning and diagnosing their needs regarding their integration (or the dangers of their non-integration). The Social Democratic Party is committed to the integration ""of the first hour"", with a cordial and deepened contact between the migrants and the authorities in charge of integration, during which the fundamental and constitutional values of our country are transmitted (fundamental rights and duties, gender equality, repression against acts of violence, separation of powers, etc.). The Social Democratic Party of Switzerland is committed to a strong integration policy with special measures in favor of women, children and young people. The main thrusts are: Emancipation from patriarchy, access to education and work. The positions of the SP: The integration process must begin immediately upon arrival in Switzerland and continue throughout the stay. It must be adapted to the respective needs of individuals and society. Stricter penal norms must be adopted so that lying and denigrating foreign communities can be punished. The federal government and the cantons must establish a national policy to combat racism and xenophobia. Foreigners must be given the right to vote and to stand for election, first at the communal and then at the cantonal level. The establishment of integration measures of the first hour for men and women is indispensable to explain our basic values and to clarify which integration measures are necessary. Each migrant should receive his or her own residence permit. Associations of migrants and recognized organizations in the field of migrant integration must receive financial support and clearly defined mandates. Language and, if necessary, literacy courses must be set up and encouraged to be attended. At the same time, childcare services must be systematically available for this purpose. The language skills of migrant children in their mother tongue and the national language of their place of residence should be specially promoted already at preschool age . An individualized offer for the recognition of existing skills and women-specific bridging additional training must be created. 10. municipalities and cantons should take measures so that migrants know about preschool activities for their children, send them there and receive financial support. 11.intercultural school mediation should be generally introduced. 12.Investment is needed in vocational and language counseling for the young immediately after their arrival in Switzerland. 13.Children without papers should be enrolled in school and procedures should be established to regulate the situation of their parents. 27. asylum policy You don't play with people's lives In December 2005, the federal parliament passed an extreme tightening of the asylum law. Both the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights are violated by Switzerland's new measures in asylum law. Thanks to the referendum launched by the Social Democratic Party, the people will be able to express their opinion on this revision in September 2006. These tightenings create numerous problems regarding their compatibility with the ECHR, with our international obligations, and even with the federal constitution. The SP Switzerland cannot and will not accept such an asylum law, as it clearly restricts the humanitarian right. Thus, undocumented asylum seekers would be refused the opening of a procedure, they would receive a non-entry decision (NEE). Under current law, undocumented persons can escape an NEE if they can credibly show that they are being persecuted. This will no longer be the case with the revised asylum law. The person seeking asylum must prove that he or she is a refugee, which only a few internationally known opposition figures will succeed in doing. This is a clear violation of the Refugee Convention. Another scandal: the exclusion from social assistance is extended to all rejected applicants. This measure will push people to the margins of society who are often already well integrated into their communities. This expansion puts particularly vulnerable people on the street (families with young children, pregnant women, unaccompanied minors, the elderly and the sick). Poverty is institutionalized. Both the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights are violated. Triste highlights of inhumanity are the notorious coercive measures with the possible extension of detention up to two years and the introduction of the medieval substitute prison sentence to force those who want to stay in Switzerland to leave the country. The current revision attacks the humanitarian tradition of Switzerland and leads to illegality and poverty without reflecting the whole migration policy. The Social Democratic Party supports an asylum policy worthy of the name and the targeted fight against abuses. All European countries recognize non-state persecution, not so Switzerland. Here, young women who flee circumcision or reject forced marriage are not considered persecuted and therefore face severe social discrimination. In the case of civil wars or tribal feuds where people's integrity or lives are at risk, refugee status is never recognized because there is no state (anymore). Certain of these individuals receive at most the fragile status of provisional admission. Since they are not considered real refugees here, these asylum seekers are of course called bogus refugees by the SVP! The Social Democratic Party demands that persecutions of a private nature also count as grounds for refugee status. While a speedy process is desirable, asylum seekers must be able to adequately defend their rights. The procedural deadlines must not be shortened to such an extent that rights can no longer be exercised. Asylum seekers must also have access to immediate, professional legal assistance free of charge. Forced inactivity, restricted mobility, segregation from society: the policy currently pursued by the Confederation leads to the destabilization of the persons concerned and to their denunciation in front of the local population. The policy demanded by the Social Democratic Party goes in exactly the opposite direction. People must be employed, they must be given the opportunity to acquire language and professional skills during their stay, they should be integrated into programs of general interest, in short, a dynamic, targeted policy is needed. The employment of asylum seekers raises their self-confidence, improves their situation and contributes to the fight against crime for livelihood. When granted asylum or provisional admission, these individuals already have integration capital that favors rapid economic independence. If the asylum is rejected, the knowledge gained and the fact that the person has remained active make it somewhat easier to return to the country of origin. The SP stands by the fundamental principle that Switzerland is an open and safe country for political refugees. But it must also be a place of refuge for people fleeing war and direct personal threat. Any restriction that seeks to curtail this right must be rejected. The positions of the SP: The Swiss humanitarian tradition must be preserved and strengthened in the sense of a genuine right to asylum. The international obligations entered into by Switzerland in the area of fundamental rights and the protection of persecuted persons must be complied with. Asylum seekers who have been rejected or confronted with a NEE may no longer be put out on the street. Acts of private violence must be recognized as persecutions; they confer the right to asylum. A balanced procedure must be established that allows asylum seekers to assert their rights effectively (such as access to immediate, professional and free legal assistance). The ban on work must be lifted. Municipalities and cantons should set up integration courses and employment programs for asylum seekers with the support and coordination of the federal government. The existing offers of courses and employment programs for asylum seekers set up by the cantons and municipalities must be assessed by the federal government in order to expand the ""good practices"". In any case, integration must take place on the first day of submission of the asylum application. All temporarily admitted persons must be allowed to bring their spouses and children to Switzerland without delay. 28. fundamental rights inalienable values Since the federal elections of 2003, the new parliament and the new, even more right-wing Federal Council have taken pleasure in calling into question fundamental values on which our constitutional state is based. In doing so, they are inspired, if not appropriated, by the extreme and populist right of this country. Fundamental norms and overriding international law are dealt with frankly. People insist on naturalization at the ballot box despite the discriminations as well as the violation of the general procedural guarantees and privacy. When the Federal Supreme Court (BG) denounced the unconstitutionality of such procedures on July 9, 2003, it took the liberty of questioning the judges' verdict and loudly speaking of manipulation. And, contrary to the principle of separation of powers, the supreme judiciary is being hastily weakened by the Council of States' decision in 2006 to drastically cut the number of federal judges and court clerks. In doing so, they freely admit that they do not know the impact of such an ukase on the institution's workload and operations. A draft law on the use of force provides for the use of batons and dogs against unruly expelled persons - dialogue and mediation, on the other hand, appear nowhere. The situation is no better in criminal law. In 2005, the parliament's decisions on internment from 2002 were called into question. A form of retrospective internment was adopted that clearly violates the European Convention on Human Rights and the Principles. Moreover, it violates the principles of criminal law that an act can only be judged once (""ne bis in idem"") and that an appeal to the disadvantage of the convicted person is not possible (""in pejus""). Under the pretext of fighting hooliganism, the Chambers approve a law that is known to violate several provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is why it is to be valid only until December 31, 2009! The SP adheres to the principle that Switzerland was created and continues to exist on the basis of strong constitutional values, which must be preserved at all costs. If fundamental rights are called into question, all human beings as well as the social cement and democracy are in danger. Respect for fundamental rights is a prerequisite for the creation and maintenance of a progressive society that aims at the development of each of its members. The positions of the SP: Only executive or administrative authorities may assess naturalization applications. The principle of separation of powers must be respected. The resources of the federal court must be commensurate with its burdens. The law and criminal proceedings must continue to comply with the principles of the rule of law and Switzerland's international obligations. The Swiss humanitarian tradition must be preserved and strengthened in the sense of a genuine right to asylum. The tax policy of the Confederation and the cantons must comply with the principle of economic efficiency. The principle of equal rights and opportunities for men and women must be implemented. Restrictions on freedoms must respect the principles of legality, public interest and proportionality. The constitution and human rights must be respected. 29. homosexuality Full equality for lesbians and gays Although on June 5, 2005, the Swiss electorate approved the partnership law for same-sex couples with 58%, lesbians and gays continue to be discriminated against. The SP Switzerland therefore continues to advocate for full equality for lesbians and gays. It demands that lesbians and gays not be further discriminated against. Lesbians and gays are to be treated as equal citizens and homophobia is to be fought. The positions of the SP: Anti-discrimination: Switzerland should ensure comprehensive protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation by private parties. Comprehensive protection means that a person who is specifically affected by discrimination can effectively defend himself or herself against it under private law, but also that preventive, legal protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is provided. In addition, Switzerland must seek ratification of the 12th Additional Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. Equality: The federal law on registered partnerships was a first step towards equality for homosexuals. Nevertheless, the partnership law has only marriage-like effects. However, a legal basis that distinguishes between homosexual and heterosexual couples and attaches different legal effects to them does not mean equality. Switzerland must therefore continue to strive for the opening of marriage. 3 Education. Homosexuality is still a taboo subject today, depending on family, cultural or religious background. Switzerland should lay the foundations and promote a level-appropriate, networked and value-neutral thematization of same-sex lifestyles in all areas of education in order to give all people the opportunity to come to terms with homosexuality. 4. public sector: Switzerland must take measures to protect homosexuals in the public sector or during protective service, especially from bullying and discrimination. 5. asylum system: In many countries of the world, homosexuality is still prosecuted today by the respective state; be it explicitly or for causing public nuisance. Moreover, in many parts of the world, a homosexual orientation leads to persecution by one's family and to honor killings. Switzerland should recognize homosexuality as a reason for asylum; regardless of whether the persecution in the home country comes from state or non-state actors. Foreign policy: Switzerland should also advocate for the recognition and protection of homosexual and bisexual people on an international level. 7. health: Lesbians and gays are statistically proven to be exposed to specific, increased health risks, for example in the area of youth suicide or breast cancer. Switzerland must therefore create and promote specific offers for information and targeted prevention as well as contact points."
43320,201110,"Switzerland can do more. It can become fairer, freer and more solidary. The following ten projects can move Switzerland forward. In the interest of the entire population. 1. WE WANT 100,000 NEW JOBS THANKS TO RENEWABLE ENERGIES INSTEAD OF BILLIONS FOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS. By 2030, at least 50% of the energy required is to come from renewable sources. Thanks to the investments in renewables called for in our cleantech initiative, 100,000 new jobs will be created in Switzerland. In this way, we are creating a sustainable economic sector. We want to hand over an intact environment to future generations and not burden them with risks due to the short-term interests of the atomlob-by. Nuclear power plants are extremely expensive, uneconomical and leave a safety and a waste problem. The future belongs to renewable energies. 2. WE WANT A PUBLIC HEALTH INSURANCE FUND INSTEAD OF AN INSURANCE FELT. We stand for good health care for all. Health insurance premiums are rising every year and more and more people are struggling to pay them. The pseu-do competition in the basic insurance benefits only the health insurance companies and the advertising industry. The insured are left with high premiums and confusion. That is why we want a public health insurance fund modeled on Suva, which provides good services and operates cost-effectively. 3. WE WANT MINIMUM LIVING WAGES FOR ALL INSTEAD OF WAGE DUMPING. People who work full time must also be able to live on their wages. It is not acceptable that companies do not pay decent wages and that social welfare has to help out. The minimum wage initiative creates more wage justice for all: A minimum wage ensures that the wages of all employees keep pace with economic growth. In recent years, bonuses and executive pay have exploded, and the wage gap has widened further. The minimum wage ensures that wages once again develop in a way that benefits everyone. 4. WE WANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR ALL INSTEAD OF PROFITS FOR A FEW. Rents continue to rise. The owners of land and houses make higher profits when demand for housing is stronger - at the expense of tenants. Meanwhile, in cities or tax-dumping cantons, even the middle class can barely afford an apartment. This must not be. Rents must correspond to actual costs. Non-profit housing or special zones for affordable housing create affordable housing. With the absorption of the planning surplus, contributions can be made to social housing construction. 5. WE WANT EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL THANKS TO DAY SCHOOLS INSTEAD OF THE SCHOOL OF YESTERYEAR. A child's educational opportunities depend on the social and economic circumstances of the parents. Today's school cannot compensate for this. Therefore, the SP wants the public school to become a day school with care and task assistance. Day schools support all children equally in their school careers and lead to better starting opportunities for all. They also make an important contribution to reconciling work and family life. 6. WE WANT A TRAINING OFFENSIVE FOR EVERYONE INSTEAD OF A LACK OF PROSPECTS FOR THE LOW-SKILLED. The life position has become the exception. Many have difficulty getting a job or have to change jobs frequently. Lifelong learning is more important than ever. Highly qualified people are already continuing their education today. Everyone should have this opportunity: With a training fund that covers the costs of training and compensates for lost wages in the case of training that lasts longer. The financing is simple: incomes above 126,000 Swiss francs should also contribute to unemployment insurance, thus providing the 450 to 600 million needed annually. 7. WE WANT AN INHERITANCE TAX TO FINANCE THE AHV INSTEAD OF FURTHER TAX PRIVILEGES. One percent of the resident population owns as much wealth as the remaining 99 percent combined. At the same time, precisely this one percent benefits from further tax breaks, for example in the case of inheritance. In Switzerland, 45 billion francs are inherited every year. Tax free. A few great heirs profit, without any benefit - equality of opportunity falls by the wayside. An inheritance tax with an exemption amount of 2 million francs guarantees more social justice. The additional revenue will directly benefit the AHV and thus the entire population. 8. WE WANT A LIFELONG WORK MODEL FOR THE OASI, INSTEAD OF A HIGHER PENSION AGE The right to a pension must be made dependent on the career of the individual and on the arduousness of the work performed. Finally, this also has an impact on life expectancy . Therefore, in the future, the retirement age must not depend solely on age, but rather the length of service must also be taken into account. As a rule, retirement is to take place after 42 years of AHV contributions - at the earliest at 62, at the latest at 65. The SP will categorically reject an increase in the retirement age as part of the 12th AHV revision. 9. WE WANT A NATIONWIDE PUBLIC SERVICE INSTEAD OF PLAYING OFF CITY AND COUNTRY The entire population benefits from a strong public service and good infrastructure. Rail and bus lines, post offices, schools and good health care in all regions hold our country together and ensure quality of life and jobs throughout Switzerland. If we save on infrastructure today, we save at the expense of Switzerland's future. Especially for the railroads, sensible investments are needed: For example, by increasing the profit tax on companies instead of imposing a one-sided burden on all users of public transport. 10. we want a strong workplace instead of a dominance of banks the financial crisis has cost 3000 trillion francs worldwide. It has shown: Investment banks and hedge funds have taken the real economy hostage. The past few years have been characterized by deregulation and self-regulation. This system has failed. That is why rules are now needed for the financial center: solutions to the ""too big to fail"" problem. Limitations on bonuses. In addition, the financial world must pay for the costs of its crises: With an international financial transaction tax that helps tame speculation on the markets."
43320,201510,"FAIR WAGES PAYABLE LIVING ROOM SECURE RENT Election platform 2015 FOR EVERYONE AT FÜR LESSEDITORIALWe are heading for a very decisive moment in 2015. On October 18, we will decide which majorities will steer our country in which direction. Where is our country heading, what kind of society do we want? The national-conservative forces want to seal off Switzerland, see migration as a problem and accept that war refugees drown in the Mediterranean. They question human rights and want to drive a wedge between the population and the institutions by dragging parliaments and governments, the courts, authorities and offices and partly also the schools and universities through the mud.There is an alternative to this national-conservative Switzerland. And here the SP, as the strongest force, wants to and must play a decisive role. We want an open, just and solidary Switzerland. We want a stable, close and reliable cooperation with Europe. We uphold our humanitarian tradition and defend human rights as an indispensable part of our law, which protects us all from arbitrariness and despotism. We fight for distributive justice in a time when wealth and income are distributed more and more unequally. And we are fighting to strengthen social welfare systems. Because they are the prerequisite for balance and peaceful coexistence in our society. We will be at the forefront of the discussions on opening up Switzerland, on the importance of our humanitarian tradition, on distributive justice and on safeguarding the social welfare systems, and we will fight to combine the forces that lead us in this direction. After all, it is our values and social democratic achievements that have ensured our country's success for decades.The confrontation between the Switzerland of openness and the Switzerland of fear will be defining in 2015. In addition, the SP will use the election year time and again to make its own tangible demands, which we discussed together and adopted on February 14 with our election platform - demands that will improve people's lives and coexistence in our society in a very concrete and targeted way.Christian Levrat FOR ALL STATUS FOR LESS ELECTION PLATFORM OF THE SP SWITZERLAND Adopted at the party congress on February 14, 2015 in Martigny Switzerland is strong when everyone is doing well - and not just a few. Every inhabitant of this country has a right to freedom, prosperity and democracy. When everyone is doing well, everyone is doing better. In Switzerland. In Europe. Around the world. Switzerland is recognized worldwide as the guardian of peace, security and stability. This is largely thanks to the SP, which has been fighting for justice in our country for 125 years. For without justice - as the history of mankind shows - peace and security cannot endure. That is why we Social Democrats fought for the AHV. We fought for maternity insurance, women's suffrage and good working conditions through collective agreements. These achievements, of which we are justifiably proud, are threatened by danger from the right. A clique of super-rich and neo-liberals has set itself the goal of dismantling Switzerland as we know it. If they have their way, freedom, prosperity and democracy will no longer be a human right, but a simple commodity - and ultimately the privilege of the highest bidder. This money aristocracy accepts only one law: the law of the fist, the law of the strongest. That is why it makes our state look ridiculous. That is why it undermines our democracy. And that is why it is fighting against Europe and driving our country into isolation internationally. But Switzerland is not an island, fortunately. We need and want good relations with Europe. Everyone in our country is now closely networked with Europe - economically and technically anyway, but also culturally, socially and emotionally. That is a fact. And there is one thing we must not forget: European integration is a great work of peace. A relapse into nationalistic times would sooner or later lead to war. Not only Europe, but also international bodies strengthen peace and justice throughout the world. The SP is committed to Switzerland playing an active role in the world so that human rights are respected everywhere, development opportunities are available everywhere and social justice grows worldwide. That is why we Social Democrats are committed to a solidary, just and open society every day. Migration brings diversity and diversity is a strength; a driver of progress, benefiting not only businesses but also the community as a cultural and social fabric. We defend the welfare state and the humanitarian tradition of our country and we develop it further. We fight for a society in which every person has his or her place and can determine his or her living conditions - whether in elections and votes or in the workplace. We fight for democracy in all areas of life, for secure pensions, fair wages, real equality and affordable housing. Because true progress has the goal of enabling all people - regardless of their origin - to live a self-determined, good life in and with society. This is what the SP stands for. 10 PROJECTS FOR A JUST, OPEN AND SOLIDARY SOCIETY 1 ENFORCE WAGE EQUALITY WITH BINDING REQUIREMENTS AND NATIONWIDE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. It has been enshrined in the constitution for 33 years that women and men are entitled to equal pay for work of equal value. But for 33 years, this principle has been trampled underfoot. On average, women earn 20 percent - just under 700 francs - less per month than men. The attempt to achieve equal pay through voluntary measures has failed. This is where politics has to help out, since the economy obviously can't do it on its own. The SP demands clear legal foundations and effective measures to ensure equal pay and to put an end to the daily discrimination of half the population. We call for wage monitoring with binding targets and sanctions. The SP is also fighting for the conclusion of collective labor agreements in all industries that include minimum wages, further training opportunities and wage scales that set a binding framework for the concrete implementation of equal pay for men and women. The CLAs offer employees protection and guarantee them fair working conditions. Today, however, only about half of them are subject to a CLA. The SP is doing everything it can to change this. 2 MINIMUM QUOTAS FOR NON-PROFIT HOUSING GUARANTEE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR ALL. Housing prices are skyrocketing in cities and conurbations, and private investors and real estate companies are profiting from this. Many tenants are at the mercy of exorbitant and unjustified rent increases when they move. Real estate companies are making record profits on their backs. At the same time, taxes are lowered for such corporations, resulting in deficits for municipalities and cantons - which are then compensated for with downsizing programs from which everyone suffers. In order to create and maintain affordable housing for all, the SP is therefore committed to promoting non-profit housing construction. Now, a minimum share of the housing stock in each municipality is to be rented according to criteria of public utility. For new zoning and new construction projects, at least 30 percent of the floor area to be credited must be re¬served for affordable housing that goes to cooperatives or remains in public ownership. Attractive housing models in centers create affordable housing for all and help stop ongoing urban sprawl. 3 THE 10 PERCENT INCREASE IN PENSIONS ENSURES AN OLD AGE IN DIGNITY. The SP is the party that has been advocating a dignified old age for decades. In addition to participation and self-determination, this also includes financial security in old age through our pension plan as well as affordable care and support services. Equally important is a fruitful and lived exchange between generations, so that solidarity can emerge and persist. Our AHV is the greatest social achievement and an important element for security in old age. The Federal Constitution requires that the pensions of the AHV and the pension fund together must guarantee the ""continuation of the accustomed standard of living in an appropriate manner"". But today, for too many people, this goal is no longer being achieved. It is claimed that the AHV is bleeding out and that the pressure on the second pillar is increasing. But contrary to all claims: Whether Switzerland can afford a decent old-age pension for all is primarily a question of political will and distributive justice - and not of age development or the conversion rate. With the AHV, we have the ideal system to reinforce social solidarity beyond the constraints of the capital markets. AHV pensions must be increased by 10 percent - without raising the retirement age. That is why the SP Switzerland supports the AHVplus initiative. As long as AHV and IV pensions do not guarantee financial security for a dignified life for all, the SP is committed to maintaining and improving supplementary benefits. It ensures that IV pensions and EL are also adjusted in the event of future adjustments to the AHV. 4 EXTENDED PROTECTION AGAINST DISMISSAL PREVENTS OLDER EMPLOYEES FROM BECOMING LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED. It is the employees who create wealth and contribute to the progress of Switzerland every day with their knowledge, skills and abilities. For that, they need decent wages, good working conditions and job security. But older workers between 50 and 65 are increasingly being squeezed out of the labor market by younger, cheaper workers - and end up in long-term unemployment through no fault of their own. This situation is untenable. The SP calls for the introduction of flexible employment models, provided that the employees concerned agree to them (e.g. reduction of working hours, bridging pension, flexible retirement age), the expansion of unemployment insurance and short-time work, especially for older employees. This secures their financial livelihood and stabilizes the economy, as it prevents consumption from collapsing. However, short-time work must be accompanied by a training offensive. Too many opportunities for education and training are not covered by ALV today. That has to change. The SP is also calling for greater protection against dismissal, which must include a mandatory obligation to give reasons. The notice periods and the criteria according to which a dismissal can be declared null and void or abusive must be expanded both in the law and in the CLA. People are more than cost factors and must not be put out on the street for no reason. 5 THE STOCK EXCHANGE TAX STOPS NONSENSICAL SPECULATION AND STABILIZES THE FINANCIAL MARKET. The bailout of the big banks has cost taxpayers billions - without imposing conditions or other consequences on those responsible. Instead, they paid out millions in wages and bonuses again in the same year. In this ""too big to fail"" logic, it is a matter of time before the banks have to be bailed out again. A large part of the billions in daily turnover of the big banks comes from computer-initiated transactions, the sole aim of which is to profit from minimal price differences with gigantic volumes. Such transactions do not bring any economic benefit, but fuel speculation and thus destabilize the financial market. The SP is fighting for the introduction of a stock exchange tax, also known as Tobin Tax or Financial Transaction Tax, which would stop such senseless buying and selling every second. This tax not only puts the brakes on nonsensical and dangerous speculation, but also generates tax revenue from an industry that is one of the few exempt from VAT. 6 THE COMPREHENSIVE INTRODUCTION OF DAYCARE CENTERS AND FREE DAY SCHOOLS LEADS TO MORE EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES. Every child has a right to a good education. This right must not depend on the parents' wallet or origin, nor on where they live. However, the principle is not implemented in everyday life: In Switzerland, children of well-off parents have better educational opportunities. This is because up to 50 percent of children in compulsory education do not speak a national language as their mother tongue. They need to be given more support. In contrast, children of well-off parents and children with the local language as their mother tongue have better educational opportunities. For the SP Switzerland, equal opportunities is a goal we work towards every day. We are fighting in the municipalities, the cantons and also at the national level for sufficient resources for public schools. Students, teachers, school infrastructure and education and training are close to our hearts. An important element of this equality of opportunity is the creation of a comprehensive day school program. The school of the future is more than just a series of lessons: The division between childcare and school must be overcome, because it cements the separation of education and training, of care and support. Day structures form an important basis for equal opportunities and provide optimal support for all children. The whole of Switzerland benefits from good education for all. 7 CHILD CREDITS PROVIDE REAL RELIEF FOR FAMILIES. For many people, the family is and remains the most important and most directly experienced form of community. But it too is subject to a variety of changes, and ""the family"" is now a term that encompasses a multitude of ways of life. The SP is the party that has always consistently supported the concerns of single parents and against discrimination against people in same-sex partnerships. For several years, the purchasing power of families has been decreasing due to the increased cost of living (rent, health insurance premiums, etc.). The pressure is so great that starting a family has now become a poverty risk factor. A full wage is not always enough for a family to live decently, and single-parent households often face hardship. An increase in child and education allowances would provide rapid and equal relief for all families. What has also changed is that, compared to the times of the ""single-earner model,"" women have gained in opportunities for professional participation and development. This often makes it necessary to reconcile family and career. In many places, there is a lack of public infrastructure such as daycare places, opportunities for part-time work for both parents or parental leave. It often takes more than a full salary to live a dignified life as a family. It is therefore wrong and unfair if child deductions, which run into the billions, are used to relieve the burden on rich families in particular. The SP calls for replacing this system with a simple and, above all, fair credit system: one credit for each child. 8 HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS MAY NOT EXCEED 10 PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME. Health insurance premiums continue to rise unchecked year after year - driven not least by competition between health insurers. For more and more normal-income households, they have become a financial burden that is almost impossible to bear. Premium reductions have not kept pace with this rapid increase in premiums; on the contrary, some cantons have even massively cut premium reductions as part of their austerity programs. This development, which burdens middle-income households in particular, must be stopped. The SP therefore wants to adapt and expand the system of individual premium reductions: The goal must be that the premium burden corresponds to a maximum of 10 percent of household income. A higher load is unbearable and unreasonable. 9 A TRAFFIC-CALMED MEETING ZONE IN EVERY AGGLOMERATION COMMUNITY FOR A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL. Mobility is an achievement, a promise of freedom. At the same time, it is a huge challenge, with drastic consequences for our quality of life. A new vision of mobility is needed; a vision that meets the different needs and conditions in rural and urban areas. An attractive post bus connection offers an alternative for motorists in rural areas. Daily traffic jams, overcrowded suburban trains, buses or streetcars characterize daily commuter life in the conurbations: We are not countering these problems with new roads, but with an attractive and well-developed public transport network. This frees up public space in the centers and agglomerations for pedestrian and bicycle traffic, for meetings and conversations. This means that everyone can move around safely and feel comfortable, air quality is improved and noise emissions are reduced - in other words: a better quality of life for everyone. 10 A RAPID AND BINDING NUCLEAR PHASE-OUT WILL ENABLE A SUCCESSFUL AND RENEWABLE ENERGY FUTURE. Switzerland needs to move quickly away from its dependence on nuclear energy. The Fukushima disaster has once again made it clear that a switch to renewable energies is urgently and quickly needed. Given the hazardous nature of nuclear power plants, it is essential to limit their lifespan to 50 years and to decommission our country's oldest three nuclear power plants immediately. At the beginning of the 21st century, we finally have the chance to initiate such an energy turnaround and free ourselves from this dependence, which is also fatal for the climate. Furthermore, entering a renewable energy era creates thousands of secure and attractive jobs. If we want to achieve this goal, the development of renewable energies must be accelerated in order to cover all our electricity consumption from inexhaustible sources by 2035 and to reduce the waste of fossil energy by 80 percent by 2050."
43320,201910,"FOR ALL INSTEAD OF A FEW The last four years have been characterized by the power of the strongest: The corporations and major shareholders ordered, while the federal government delivered. In this way, the right-wing majority has turned politics into a self-service store for the powerful lobbies. Whether in health care, tax policy or the climate: everywhere in parliament, the interests of the powerful and wealthy prevail at the expense of the vast majority. On October 20, we can set a new course. Instead of an irresponsible policy for the few, we need a policy of togetherness that focuses on the common good. Because Switzerland is strong when everyone is doing well and not just a few. Our topics Equality Climate Work Health COMPATIBILITY INSTEAD OF DISCRIMINATION Women often reduce their employment when they have children. Maternity thus becomes an economic risk. Many women reduce their employment again as soon as relatives require care. As a result, incomes and pensions are falling. Women are still subject to massive wage and pension discrimination: on average, they receive 40% less pension than men. This is despite the fact that equality has been enshrined in the constitution since 1981. This is untenable. We need more and cheaper out-of-family child care and good, publicly funded care for the elderly. Equal pay must finally be effectively enforced, and disregard must be punished. But instead of taking action, the bourgeois majority is preventing effective measures. In doing so, it cements the barriers to women's equal participation in the workforce on a daily basis. Our demands for a Switzerland of togetherness Low-cost daycare centers instead of tax giveaways In Switzerland, parents have to spend two to four times more on childcare than in neighboring countries. This particularly affects families with little money. But instead of supporting these families, the right-wing majority merely increases tax deductions for childcare costs. This benefits the wealthy families. At the same time, the Civic Democrats reject the SP's demands for low-cost daycare centers. In this context, daycare centers are a key element of early care and preschool education. The public sector must promote them. With the children instead of WK Fathers now receive the same amount of leave for the birth of a child as they do for a move - one day. The right-wing majority, however, sees no need for action. This is too expensive for the economy, he said. Not too expensive for the economy, however, are the military refresher courses to which men are drafted year after year. We think that is wrong. We therefore call for parental leave for mothers and fathers of 38 weeks, which can be divided equally between the parents. Protection from domestic violence instead of an assault rifle in the closet Every three weeks, a woman dies in Switzerland as a result of violence by her (ex-) partner. 40% of homicides and half of rapes occur in the home. For years, we have been calling on the federal government to develop a national strategy to protect against domestic violence and to provide better support for women's shelters. The parliament, dominated by bourgeois men, rejects all our demands and turns a blind eye to the facts. We want to put an end to this irresponsible policy on October 20. PROTECTING THE CLIMATE INSTEAD OF THE INTERESTS OF THE OIL INDUSTRY The climate crisis is the greatest threat of our time. For decades, the SP has been offering concrete solutions on how we can actively and socially counteract climate heating. However, the right-wing majority is preventing progress. Instead, it defends the interests of corporations that make profits from environmental destruction. We need to act urgently! We must push ahead with the ecological transformation and stop the investments of banks and pension funds in fossil energies (oil, natural gas, etc.). We demand: Invest in Switzerland instead of importing oil. An active climate policy promotes promising technologies and creates jobs. Our demands for a sustainable Switzerland SME innovations instead of oil billions Every year, around ten billion Swiss francs flow from Switzerland to large corporations and states to import oil and gas. We want to use these funds domestically. For the ecological transformation, we must promote the cleantech industry. In the last ten years, 40,000 new jobs have already been created in this way. Solar energy in particular must be expanded. But the right-wing majority has blocked all efforts to save the climate for years. Whether with the Energy Strategy 2050 or the CO2 Act - in the Federal Parliament, the bourgeois majority serves the interests of the few and forgets the well-being of people and nature. Promote public transport instead of expanding highways Our mobility is responsible for almost half of domestic CO2 emissions. In order for Switzerland to become climate-neutral by 2050 in accordance with the requirements of the Paris Agreement, private motorized transport must decline. To this end, we want to promote public transport. At the same time, we want to switch to e-mobility. But instead of moving forward on the climate issue and meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement, the right-wing majority continues as before. In the current legislature, it has decided to spend ten billion Swiss francs on the expansion of highways instead of on climate protection. Less CO2 emissions instead of short-term profits The Swiss financial center actively contributes to climate heating. The assets invested with us cause ten times more emissions worldwide than Switzerland emits annually/than are emitted in Switzerland annually. We demand that no more Swiss money be invested in the development of fossil fuels by 2030. Pension funds would be required to divest shares in companies that produce coal, gas or oil within the next five years. But the right-wing majority rejects any regulation. In doing so, it puts the interests of corporations ahead of the greater good. Job opportunities for all instead of unemployment from 50 onwards More and more people over 50 are having trouble finding a job. Digitalization is exacerbating this development. At the same time, many young people are experiencing difficulties entering the workforce. Many refugees want to work. Instead of supporting those affected, the right-wing majority rejects effective measures for work and training. There is even talk of raising the retirement age. We want to break the power of the strongest. This is because this policy leaves workers to their fate if they are considered too old or do not have the appropriate training. Rapid technological change is exacerbating the situation. We therefore call for better protection against dismissal for older employees and a training fund to finance training and living costs. Because tight finances often prevent further training. The federal government and companies should work together to create a fund that will give young and old people better job opportunities. Our demands for a Switzerland of togetherness Training offensive instead of a wave of layoffs Tens of thousands of people in Switzerland would like to work, but cannot. Because they are supposedly too old, because as women they cannot manage the re-entry after a family break or because they are not qualified enough for the labor market. We call for the federal government to help fund models that allow on-the-job training for adults."" The SP wanted to respond to the rapidly increasing demands on the labor market with an education fund, but the right-wing majority in parliament rejected our demands. Instead, it is putting together packages of cuts in education, leaving those affected out in the cold. Better protection against dismissal instead of retirement age 67 It is scandalous that employees over 50 are repeatedly put on the street because of their age. Discrimination on the basis of age must be prohibited. However, our proposals for more job security in old age were rejected by the right-wing majority in parliament. Instead, the current majority situation threatens retirement age 67. This asocial policy of the power of the strongest on the backs of older people should be punished on October 20. Train refugees instead of discriminating against them The majority of recognized refugees have vocational training or practical work experience from their country of origin. We demand that the skills acquired abroad be credited and promoted. Federal funding for integration is to be significantly increased so that refugees can earn their own money as quickly as possible. An education offensive is needed. Barriers must be removed so that people can gain a foothold in the labor market. Small successes have already been achieved. But as long as the right-wing majority sees refugees primarily as a ""problem,"" there will be no better integration. LOWER PREMIUMS INSTEAD OF UNBEARABLE BURDENS For many households, health insurance premiums are a major financial burden. But instead of easing the burden on budgets, many cantons are cutting premium reductions. In some cases, the cuts even finance tax giveaways for those who need it least. At the same time, costs are rising inexorably. High drug prices and sometimes outrageous salaries for chief physicians contribute to the fact that the health care system is becoming more and more expensive. With the Premium Relief Initiative, we demand that no household should have to spend more than 10% of its disposable income on health insurance premiums. This will particularly ease the burden on families and people with low incomes. And there is increasing pressure on the public sector to take effective action against the ever-rising cost of healthcare. Our demands for a Switzerland of togetherness Premium reduction instead of ""health insurance light Health insurance is financed through capitation premiums. Right-wing parliamentarians even demand the introduction of a ""health insurance light"". A rich person pays the same premium as one with little money. The unsocial character of these capitation premiums is cushioned by premium reductions for people with low and medium incomes. But in recent years, right-wing majorities in the cantons have cut funding for premium reductions. The latter should no longer cover expensive services, such as cancer treatment, and become the health insurance fund of the poor. We are fighting back against this anti-social policy and are campaigning for affordable premiums and a healthcare system for all with the Premium Relief Initiative. Promoting health instead of financing profits For pharmaceutical companies, health insurers, private hospitals, investors and other players, healthcare is a billion-dollar business. Their lobbyists sit in parliament and know no inhibitions about giving their donors advantages in the healthcare market. Under the guise of competition, they weaken the role of the public sector and drive up costs. We, the premium payers, foot the bill. We must put an end to this policy in the interests of the richest. In the future, premiums should finance health services and no longer the profits of pharmaceutical companies, health insurers and private hospitals. To this end, we propose a package of measures in the SP health paper. Reduce drug prices instead of increasing profits Thanks to pressure from the SP, drug prices have been reduced to such an extent that savings of several hundred million are possible every year. However, the right-wing majority is preventing further urgent measures to reduce drug prices. Generic drugs are still more than twice as expensive in Switzerland as abroad. While the bourgeoisie is securing the profits of the pharmaceutical companies, they are at the same time threatening a gradual increase in the deductibles. The rising costs would thus be passed on directly to the sick. This hits the weakest hardest."
43420,199910,"Safety through renewal. What we have achieved. What we want to achieve. With you. 11.08.1999 Dear Ladies and Gentlemen We are all experiencing a period of upheaval today; globalization is the keyword here. Labor, knowledge and capital are being reweighted. Despite many new opportunities, uncertainty is also spreading. The future of your families, the security of your jobs, your personal security, your retirement provision: many things no longer seem as simple and secure for years to come as they once did. The question for all of us is whether we can close our eyes to these changes or whether we want to understand and accept the new conditions as a common challenge. All of these changes take place in your everyday life. You worry about your children's education, you worry about the future of your jobs, you worry about your disposable income in the face of ever-increasing tax bills and social and other charges. You worry about the safety of your families in the face of violence and crime, you are concerned about ever-increasing premium bills for your health. Your worries are our worries. We want to create the conditions so that these problems can be solved. In order to find and implement real solutions to problems, politics does not need ideologies, but proposed solutions. Globalization is, on the one hand, a real economic process, but on the other hand, it is also a name for that world revolution which was triggered by the sudden collapse of Soviet communism. The systemic question of capitalism versus socialism has been settled since the turn of the year 1989 I 90. Today it is about the system question within capitalism. The socialist notion of tight political regulation of economic activities, or even the attempt to control them through politics by means of the state and its bureaucracy, is outdated. This statist political model of the left is in crisis. Anxious protection of vested interests, frightened defense of the status qua achieved, or even a defiant ""business as usual"" lead to crisis. The necessary economic productivity, however, requires not only more market and less state, but also social cohesion, modernization and justice. Modernization is therefore necessary not only in economic and financial policy. Modernization is needed in other policy areas as well. Security and foreign policy can no longer simply be oriented toward the ""enemy in Moscow."" Globalization is forcing new political parameters and levels of action. Foreigner and asylum policies face different challenges than, for example, in World War 2. The protection of ecological foundations is another problem. In these areas, too, there are political forces that want to solve the questions posed with dogma administration without prospects for solutions. But here, too, development cannot simply be halted. Where this succeeds, it merely amounts to postponing the problems, for which there is then usually a high price to pay. The FDP considers a dual modernization of the economy and society to be necessary for Switzerland's future viability. Initial successes have been achieved in the past three years. For example, the unemployment rate has fallen from 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 1997 to below 3 percent. Federal budget restructuring is in sight. The necessary investments in transport infrastructure have been decided. The preconditions for the bilateral treaty have been created. In the social sector, it was possible to prevent an expansion of services without sustainable funding. The army and civil defense are reorganized. This path of renewal that has begun must be continued. Only renewal creates security in the future. After the failure of socialism, this is about a bourgeois renewal. Here, the FDP wants to play a significant role as a civic force of reason. For all of us, the question of where we and our families will be in ten years is harder to answer than it used to be. What we all want, however, is freedom and security. Freedom to take responsibility for our own lives, freedom of gainful employment, freedom of life and family. Security from unemployment and poverty, security from crime and violence, security in one 's own country. In order to preserve freedom and achieve this security, we must renew Switzerland responsibly in some areas and with a liberal program: persevering, predictable and open-minded. We believe that this requires the civic force of renewal: the FDP. The FDP has no majority in either the Federal Council or Parliament. We can therefore never implement our policies without compromise. To claim otherwise would be dishonest. We can, however, go all out and seek political majorities for our solutions to problems. We first work out our positions completely independently. Only later can the compromise be sought. However, there is no compromise at any price. Nor should there be a strategy of defeat in order to be able to confine oneself to complaining. This is what we want to do - together with you - in the next four years: We want Switzerland to step up its efforts in crisis regions instead of suffering or enduring unchecked immigration and conflicts in Switzerland We are committed to a consistent foreign asylum policy. We advocate for more Swiss aid in crisis regions so that displaced persons no longer have to flee to Central Europe. We are committed to clear rules and short procedures in the area of asylum. We are committed to preventing foreign conflicts from taking place in Switzerland. We are committed to ensuring that more money and the right tools are available to fight violence and crime. We want to enable more work instead of introducing technology and work bans We are committed to creating new jobs. We are committed to the rapid implementation of the bilateral agreements so that new markets can be opened up for Swiss products and services. We are committed to ensuring that Switzerland invests more money in education. Money that can be saved thanks to fewer interest payments on public debt. We want more net income for everyone and secure pension provision instead of burden redistribution from the past to the future We are committed to secure financing of pension provision. We advocate a tax freeze so that everyone has more net disposable income. We are committed to healthy public finances so that tax francs are not increasingly used for interest payments. We are committed to keeping our world-class health care affordable. We want Switzerland to work confidently with its neighbors - instead of withdrawing from Europe and the world We are committed to the rapid implementation of the bilateral agreements. We advocate sensible accompanying measures that must not be allowed to nullify the advantages of the bilateral agreements. Through participation in the UN and through a security policy that is more oriented toward cooperation, problems in the areas of asylum and internal security, among others, can be better solved. Ladies and Gentlemen We are all experiencing a period of upheaval. We may close our eyes and be deluded into thinking that by ""carrying on as before"" or by ""standing still"" all problems can be successfully solved. But with such behavior we would only suppress our worries. We Free Democrats agree that we must see the changes as an opportunity if we want to lead Switzerland into a free and secure future. That is why we are putting the following message above our political manifesto: Security through renewal. In order for us to achieve this goal, it will take all of us. Help fight insecurity in a positive way and restore freedom and security. Help push through the necessary renewals. I thank you already today for that. Yours sincerely Franz Steinegger We love Switzerland and stand by it We Free Democrats have been involved in government since the founding of the modern federal state in 1848 - Switzerland as we know it today. We bear a great responsibility for what has happened and should continue to happen in this country. The great liberal tradition in our country obliges us to deal responsibly with our heritage, the Swiss federal state. We stand by this management responsibility. We are the only party to have developed ideas about what our country will look like in eight years. Vision 2007 gives us a guiding framework for our short- and medium-term policy goals. This should enable us to solve today's problems not from the moment, but with a long-term perspective. In doing so, we continue to focus on the values that have made Switzerland strong: Freedom, performance, responsibility, openness and security. Because we love Switzerland and stand by it. We stand by Switzerland as it has grown. We see the diversity and multilingualism of our country as a strength that we want to preserve. We fight for the cohesion of Switzerland and the mutual respect of the language regions. We stand by our responsibility as a governing party and fight against a policy that wants to take the people for fools. We represent the independent liberal policy, but we are ready to cooperate with other forces that share our goals. Because we love this Switzerland, we want to preserve and secure it. This requires responsible renewal. We want to tackle this renewal together with all citizens of Switzerland. If we go to work together with good courage and determination, we will achieve more freedom and security for all. This is precisely our goal, which is both simple and ambitious at the same time. We want to enable more work instead of introducing technology and work bans What have we done? Our policies have made work possible and achieved a turnaround in the labor market: Unemployment rates have fallen since the fourth quarter. 1997 from 5.7 to below three percent. We have pledged to improve the framework conditions for business in such a way that new jobs can be created. Swiss Post, Swisscom, SBB and agriculture were brought closer to the free market. Thanks to the reorganization of the federal finances, which is within reach, investors are once again betting on Switzerland as a place to work and think, since a major inflation has become less likely. Thanks to the new labor law, labor is little regulated by European standards. In contrast to Germany, Switzerland has succeeded in reforming corporate taxation. Thanks to the successful fight against technology and advertising bans, access to promising technologies is maintained. Important reform projects have been initiated in the education sector: Universities of applied sciences have been established, and vocational schools are being upgraded. What do we want to do? ln economic policy: In order to create new jobs and secure existing ones, service providers, industry and commerce, SMEs and agriculture need the best possible framework conditions. That is why we are committed: to flexible conditions on the labor market. Employees need protection against abuse. However, the will to perform and commitment must not be restricted by laws. Therefore, longer store opening hours and easier conditions for overtime are necessary. Longer opening hours means enabling more work. for the economic realization of gender equality. Family commitments must no longer be an obstacle on the labor market. Childcare places, block times at elementary school and flexible forms of work are to be promoted. Equalizing women and men economically means making more work possible. for the free agreement of wages between employees and employers/social partners. Comprehensive state minimum wages would lead to simpler jobs being rationalized away without replacement. Many people are turned down for these jobs. They must not be driven into unemployment. No government minimum wages means enabling more work. for tax incentives for business relocation and venture capital. Taxes are playing an increasingly important role in the business community's decision on where to locate and thus where to create jobs. New and replacement investments in Switzerland must therefore be given preferential tax treatment. Less taxes means enabling more work. for the reduction of administrative barriers to the establishment and operation of SMEs. If self-employed SME entrepreneurs have to use one out of every six working days to fill in forms, time is poorly spent. Regulations and restrictions must be dismantled, and the state must approach the self-employed with the presumption of trust rather than the presumption of abuse. Fewer administrative barriers means enabling more work. for lowering mandatory wage percentages. The structures of unemployment insurance must be thoroughly rethought with the aim of significantly increasing efficiency and substantially reducing costs. As a result, the current three percent of wages for unemployment insurance can be partially saved in the future. Fewer wage percentages means enabling more work. ln education policy: In order to create new jobs and secure existing ones, people in Switzerland need a first-class school and education system by global standards. Life and labor market skills must be maintained through lifelong learning. That is why we are committed: for a further training offensive that encompasses as many people as possible. New technologies and changing needs in working life make continuous training a must. The further training is financed by the beneficiaries and the state is to issue success-dependent further training vouchers. Employers should reward continuing education efforts. The complete continuing education expenses are to become tax deductible. Those who evolve with the requirements remain fit for the labor market. Encouraging continuing education means enabling more work. for internal education reform. Compulsory schooling must focus on teaching core knowledge, promote holistic thinking and teamwork, and once again offer more incentives for achievement. The knowledge of how to tackle something and the learned willingness to perform result in better chances on the labor market. - Making compulsory education more relevant means making more work possible. for better coordination of the education systems between the cantons. Today, many families are required to be mobile; it is not uncommon for several moves to take place during the children's educational years. If a completely different school model applies in each canton again, this makes it more difficult to connect. Exaggerated cantonalism prevents the easy transfer of schoolchildren when they change their place of residence and stands in the way of exchange between the different parts of the country. Young people today need a complete basic education to have better chances on the labor market. Better coordination of education systems between cantons means enabling more work. for better support for the gifted and talented. Less gifted students receive remedial courses and special attention. But gifted students also need targeted support if their potential is not to be stunted. People with extraordinary talents can, under certain circumstances, bring extraordinary benefits to society as a whole: in research, science, culture, sports and business, they set trends and create new opportunities. Better support for the gifted means enabling more work. for more intensive cooperation between universities and industry in teaching and research. Teaching must be geared more than it is today to the needs of the economy. Applied research must focus on areas with real market opportunities. In this way, research also creates (production) jobs. Promoting marketable research results means enabling more work. for better collaboration among universities in research and education. Each university must concentrate on its strengths in research; this prevents expensive duplication and increases the quality of education. ln education, cooperation must be strengthened. This gives graduates the best possible conditions for the job market. ln research, on the other hand, universities are facing fierce competition. Creating the best possible quality of education at universities means enabling more work. We want more net income for everyone and a secure pension plan instead of burden redistribution from the past to the future. What have we done? We have pledged to put the federal treasury in order. Thanks to the 2001 budget target and the 98 stabilization program, the balance is within reach. We have pledged to provide the money to finance the AHV and the necessary public transport projects. Today, the transport projects are being implemented, they are creating jobs. We have pledged to prevent any further tax increases alongside this. We have not been able to do that, which is why we are now calling for the tax freeze. What do we want to do? ln financial and tax policy: To maintain confidence in Switzerland as a place to work and think, we need healthy public coffers, a low overall tax and government spending ratio and no inflation. That is why we are committed: for the implementation of the 2001 budget target. Healthy public coffers and no new debts create confidence and prevent ever-increasing debt interest payments, which we and our children will have to pay through taxes today and tomorrow. Creating healthy public coffers means more net for everyone. for the tax freeze. For a period of at least seven years, the Confederation may introduce or increase new taxes, social security contributions and other levies only if existing taxes, social security contributions or other levies under federal law are reduced to the same extent. We must stop the excessive tax growth. With the FDP's tax freeze initiative, we are reducing the tax burden in Switzerland. Yes to the tax freeze means more net for everyone. for the simplification of the subsidy system. Today, a myriad of subsidies are distributed in an elaborate manner. Scarce government funds generally need to be linked to real need and should be distributed as simple direct payments. This can save a lot of tax money. Creating a simpler subsidy system means more net for everyone. for lean and efficient public administrations. Core government tasks must be performed in a customer-oriented, professional manner and as economically as possible. Administrative units receive global budgets for the services they provide. Services that can be provided just as well - or better, i.e. more cheaply and with the same quality - by private companies are outsourced. This can save taxpayers' money. Restricting the state to its core tasks means more net benefits for all. for more public tasks to be carried out at cantonal or municipal level. If communes and cantons solve as many tasks as possible together, the effort for the individual commune will be smaller. Wrongly understood ""Kantönligeist"", on the other hand, leads to duplications. The outsourcing of public tasks is more economical if larger administrative units can be taken over by private companies. Here, too: Avoiding duplication saves taxpayers' money. Consolidation of tasks across cantons means more net for everyone. for the new financial equalization among the cantons. By unbundling the now confusing flows of money between the federal government and the cantons, the rule should once again apply: He who pays, commands. The savings run into billions, which in turn benefits taxpayers. Rapid implementation of the new financial equalization means more net income for all. for the genuine inclusion of ecological aspects in the tax system. Energy prices are intended to indicate that their consumption in most cases is associated with an environmental impact. Sustainability and responsibility for future generations must be taken into account. Therefore, the introduction of a modest energy levy is reasonable. However, this must be offset in full by the reduction in wage percentages. The creation of a new subsidy economy, such as the energy subsidy levy, must be rejected. Reduction of wage percentages means more net for all. ln social policy: The state will be overburdened with the current social security system in the near future. The increasing proportion of older people and of people drawing pensions outside the work process threatens the security of social security systems. That is why we employ and: for the safeguarding of the social security system. The Federal Council has not drawn the necessary conclusions from the overviews of the social welfare systems. We therefore demand a binding statement on what further development of the social welfare system the Federal Council is aiming for in view of the endangered financing. Only if it is clear where the journey is headed can pensions be secured for everyone who pays into the social security system. Until this overall concept is available, further revisions of the social security system should be dispensed with. Presenting a binding, sensible overall concept for the social welfare system means securing pension provision for all. for fighting constantly higher health insurance premiums. First and foremost, the benefits of the mandatory basic insurance must be limited from the desirable to the necessary. Further nationalization of health care must be opposed. It would lead to poorer overall medical care for the population. Fighting rising premiums means more net for everyone. for preserving the three-pillar pension system. The tried-and-tested system with AHV, occupational pension provision and private pension provision is intended to secure existence in old age as well. If necessary, supplementary benefits are to be provided. Those who want to maintain a lavish lifestyle in old age must rely on private pension provision for this purpose. The third pillar must be strengthened to promote personal responsibility. Restricting AHV and occupational pension provision to what is necessary means secure provision for all. for rewarding work performance instead of unemployment. Unemployment insurance must be restructured so that working is always more rewarding than receiving social benefits. To this end, the necessary incentives must be created and abuses consistently combated. The structures of unemployment insurance must be thoroughly rethought with the aim of significantly increasing efficiency and substantially reducing costs. This will secure the financing of the heavily loss-making unemployment insurance system. Sensible restructuring of unemployment insurance means secure provision for all. We want Switzerland to step up its efforts in the crisis regions instead of suffering or enduring unchecked immigration and conflicts in Switzerland What have we done? We have pledged to take decisive action against crime and its causes. Thanks to liberal initiatives, internal security has been improved in many cantons. So far, it has largely been possible to prevent foreign conflicts - for example between hostile ethnic groups - from being carried out on Swiss territory. We have pledged to modernize asylum policy. We have put pressure on the creation of a foreign asylum policy that seeks to prevent refugee movements on the ground if possible. Today, the Swiss Armed Forces also perform important tasks in crisis regions. In Switzerland, we pushed through a new asylum law on June 13, 1999, which creates clear rules. What do we want to do? ln asylum policy: Bosnia and Kosovo show that as much aid as possible must be provided locally so that displaced persons are not forced to flee to Central Europe. Moreover, Switzerland must not become the substitute asylum country for all European states. However, Switzerland should maintain a fair asylum procedure and offer a safe haven to genuinely persecuted persons. That is why we are committed: for the creation of an actual foreign asylum policy. More aid on the ground in cooperation with international organizations helps prevent refugee flows. However, local aid is also an expression of our solidarity with other countries that are also helping. The Disaster Relief Corps, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, and the Federal Office for Foreign Economic Affairs must proceed in an even more coordinated manner than before. All cooperation agreements must include clauses whereby recipient countries commit to allowing entry of rejected asylum seekers from the country in question. The role of the Swiss Armed Forces in missions abroad must be strengthened. Weapons for self-protection of these volunteer troops are a must. More and better help on the ground means less unchecked immigration and return. for a reduction in Switzerland's appeal as a country of asylum. Asylum procedures must be further streamlined and shortened in a special asylum procedure law. The possibilities for complaint are to be restricted. A time-consuming asylum procedure must not be followed by a time-consuming deportation and expulsion procedure. Savings incentives are intended to lower the standard of care in the asylum system, which is sometimes too high. The federal government must provide shared accommodation for asylum seekers who enter the country illegally and for applicants who either do not comply with official requirements or refuse to cooperate reasonably in the procedure. Criminal asylum seekers who cannot be deported should be able to be interned for up to a further 15 months after serving their sentence, as well as foreign nationals who refuse to be deported. Lower return thresholds must apply to asylum seekers who have committed crimes, and deportation decisions must be enforced consistently at the federal level. Clear rules in the asylum procedure means less unchecked immigration. for the return of displaced persons as quickly as possible, as soon as the conditions are met. Already in the case of group admission of persons in need of protection, the conditions under which repatriation will be carried out must be clearly determined. If these conditions remain undefined, it will be more difficult to consistently repatriate all people who have immigrated as persons in need of protection. Clear and timely description of the conditions for return means less unchecked immigration. for Switzerland to be linked to the EU agreements of Dublin and Schengen. ln the future, an asylum application will only be examined once in the signatory states, and any negative decision will then apply to all states. ln Switzerland, on the other hand, an asylum application from the same person would have to go through the entire procedure again. Switzerland is thus in danger of becoming a substitute asylum country for the whole of Europe. Linking Switzerland to the Dublin and Sehengen agreements means less unchecked immigration. for better integration of those asylum seekers who have been granted a settlement permit. Young people in particular are to be supported in learning the language and in vocational training. Fullest possible integration reduces the risk of falling into violence and criminality. Better integration of refugees means preventing conflicts in Switzerland. ln security policy: The security map of the world has changed. The classic warlike confrontation on land has become unlikely for Switzerland in the short and medium term. But new threats and challenges have emerged: Organized crime, international terrorism, threats to information networks, and migration from crisis areas. That is why today we need a holistic internal and external security policy and more cooperation with other states. That is why we are committed: - for the maintenance of Switzerland's neutrality. Neutrality means military non-participation in armed conflicts in the sense of international law, staying away from military alliances and not making territory available. The question of whether Switzerland will have to return to neutrality at some point in the interests of its own security will be the subject of a later assessment of the situation. Within the limits of neutrality, Switzerland must make full use of its room for maneuver; missions in crisis regions are possible and necessary. By maintaining neutrality, Switzerland is credible as a provider of good services and can thus contribute to the fight against conflicts. Maintaining neutrality means preventing conflicts with Swiss involvement. for maintaining the militia army. New, more flexible models of service must be introduced, and the proportion of permanently available professional military personnel must be increased. In order to create professional forces and improve the training of militia soldiers, more professional officers and NCOs are needed. Maintaining the militia army means sharing responsibility for security. for greater cooperation between Switzerland and its neighbors and with international organizations. Partnership for Peace in the framework of NATO, Western European Union, UN and OSCE. Joint security efforts reduce the risk of conflict between the states involved. Stronger cooperation in security policy means preventing conflicts with Swiss involvement. for arming Swiss troops deployed abroad for self-protection. Those who provide aid in conflict regions must be able to protect themselves and their material against criminal gangs. The right to self-defense is the least we owe our soldiers on the ground. Arming for self-protection means security for Swiss on foreign missions. for the fight against old and new forms of crime at home. In order to be able to guarantee internal security again, urgent measures must be taken. Police forces must be provided with the necessary tools and resources. Measures include: Increasing visible police presence, stopping illegal residents, using detention pending deportation and targeted building checks. The conditions for efficient surveillance of border areas and transit axes must be improved through coordinated efforts by the federal government (border guard corps, army and police forces) and the cantons (police). Fighting all forms of crime means more security for all. We want Switzerland to cooperate confidently with its neighbors instead of withdrawing from Europe and the world What have we done? We have pledged to create the conditions for the conclusion of bilateral agreements with the EU. Bilateral treaties were the alternative of the EEA opponents at the time. In land transport, the ""yes"" vote for the major rail projects and the associated financing created the conditions for concluding the contracts as a whole. What do we want to do? First and foremost, the bilateral treaties must be implemented quickly. The bilateral agreements bring better market access, easier conditions for the free movement of persons, more rights in air transport and better research cooperation. Accompanying measures are only useful insofar as they do not nullify the benefits of the contracts. Strengthening Switzerland's participation in the international community makes UN accession a sensible option. Switzerland should not only pay, but also have a say. In the area of security policy, cooperation with friendly states must be expanded. That is why we are committed: for the rapid domestic implementation of the bilateral agreements. Business, research and science should be able to benefit from the advantages as quickly as possible. The accompanying measures are to be limited in time and scope. Implementing the bilateral treaties quickly means working confidently with our neighbors. for Switzerland to join the United Nations (UN). Switzerland should not only pay, but also have a say. Nor does UN membership pose any problems in terms of neutrality. Joining the UN means working confidently with our neighbors. for the development of cross-border regional cooperation. Cooperation in business, science and culture must be strengthened across national borders. Friendly relationships benefit everyone involved. The already existing Euregios are good examples of this. Promoting cross-border regional cooperation means working confidently with our neighbors. for increased Swiss participation in all international economic policy organizations. As a small export nation, Switzerland benefits from open markets. It must therefore work to secure an open world trading system and improve market access for all countries. Greater participation in the WTO and UN sub-organizations means working confidently with our neighbors. for an intensive dialogue on the European question as soon as the bilateral treaties are in force. On the basis of the 1999 Integration Report, Switzerland's further steps are to be examined. The ""Yes to Europe"" initiative, which calls for the immediate start of accession negotiations, should be rejected. Discussing the European question openly means creating the conditions to cooperate confidently with our neighbors. Our goals for 2003 Instead of just making promises, we want to focus on implementing four important goals. We are fighting for this with all our might: (Definitive wording still pending) Value-based increase in Swiss exports by twenty percent Less than 50,000 unemployed Fewer taxes for everyone Completion of all asylum applications within 3 months as well as lower crime and higher clearance rates In this way, we achieve growth, more jobs, more social welfare and more security. Measure us by our deeds! If you want to help us make this manifesto a reality, vote FDP candidates into parliament on October 24, 1999.

43420,200710,"Four projects for Switzerland. Intelligent Switzerland - the knowledge society with the best start-up opportunities Growing Switzerland - Europe's leading growth nation Social, fair and modern Switzerland - optimal opportunities for individual success Open Switzerland - a progressive, internationally networked society Who are we? We are liberal, optimistic, independent! We Free Democrats founded modern Switzerland. We are standing at the origin of the political system of 1848, which still determines political events in our country today. The homeland that we hold dear is thus of liberal origin. Liberal thought has evolved and, in the meantime, adapted to the realities of the 21st century; but today, as in the past, it has the same goal: to guarantee individual freedom and dignity, as well as democratic order in a society that positively values the pursuit of success. We Liberals promote a climate of progress in Switzerland and the competition. We stand up for the personal freedom of the individual in society, business, science and culture. We fight for the constant adaptation of our political and social instruments to the new realities. We reject taboos and prejudices. We liberals want a lean, strong state that creates the framework for freedom and justice. We want a society in which people have the chance to shape their lives as they see fit. We rely on the sense of responsibility of each individual. We are the party that is in constant dialogue with the people. We discuss openly with people and want to win them over for new solutions. We also want to implement difficult reforms together with the population. We are the party of content. Those who vote for the FDP choose intelligence and courage. We want to develop and shape content; our heads bear responsibility Who chooses us? We want to convince new voters! The liberal-democratic party appeals without exception to all people who share these liberal values of courage and optimism for the future. We are the party for liberal, modern people who are open to progress. We are represented in all regions of Switzerland, are rooted in the middle classes, and can tap the greatest potential among younger, female and urban voters in addition to the existing electorate. What kind of society do we want? We want an open, just, future-oriented Switzerland! The responsible citizen with his abilities and his own initiative is at the center of society. The state provides the necessary framework so that every individual has the chance to succeed. Performance and success are valued positively in Switzerland. Societies that strive for success on the basis of liberal values are successful and just because they offer equal opportunities. We need to open up - both internally and to the outside world. Successful Switzerland has always been characterized by an open society. Switzerland's history shows that opening up is an opportunity, not a threat. We are one of the most successful knowledge societies. The prerequisite for this is a willingness to perform, combined with investment in education. Switzerland is an excellent location for research, business and international organizations. Reforms based on these principles will improve the competitiveness of Switzerland as a business location and thus increase prosperity in the country. The Swiss population can face the future with optimism; confidence is taking the place of fear. What projects are we pursuing? In the interest of Switzerland and the people living in Switzerland, we want to pursue four comprehensive goals. 1. intelligent Switzerland - the knowledge society with the best starting opportunities Switzerland is one of the world's leading centers of thought and knowledge. Education systems are harmonized and aligned to the best standards. They have business and family-friendly structures that also serve to integrate young foreigners into our society. The Swiss school and vocational training systems are based on the principle of equal opportunities and thus make a significant contribution to equalizing the social classes. Quality and performance are promoted and given high priority in education at all levels. Swiss university studies enjoy a worldwide reputation. Research is a political priority in Switzerland and focuses on areas with a promising future. Research develops within a framework characterized by freedom and responsibility. The motto is: rules instead of bans and moratoriums. Switzerland uses natural resources sustainably. Innovative ideas are not only formulated in Switzerland, but also implemented in concrete terms. Business and government are embracing new technologies and vigorously supporting the implementation of new solutions. The motto is: more investment in intelligence and capabilities instead of structural maintenance and unnecessary concrete. II Growing Switzerland - Europe's leading growth nation Switzerland is a leading growth nation. The financial budgets of the federal government and the cantons are healthy. The economy is innovative thanks to competition and the internal market is characterized by efficient structures adapted to competition. Small, medium and large companies operating in the domestic market and internationally find locational advantages in Switzerland. There are strong incentives for the creation of new jobs. Companies come to Switzerland to develop new technologies because they are welcome in our country and find the best, most motivated workforce and optimal framework conditions. Administrative procedures are simplified and bureaucratic obstacles that stand in the way of entrepreneurship are removed. The long-term stability and predictability of the legal system is ensured; the rights of appeal are subject to the principle of proportionality. Government tasks are periodically reviewed with regard to their contribution to the country's prosperity and competitiveness, and are cancelled if they are not justified. This will create room for maneuver and secure financing for the assumption of any new tasks. The government share and fiscal quota will be reduced rather than increased further. The tax system has been simplified and made more efficient and transparent. In contrast to consumption, labor, production and income are less affected. There is trust between taxpayers and the tax administration and the application of tax laws is predictable. Special attention is paid to relieving the burden on families and small and medium-sized businesses. The disposable income of citizens has risen and the market has been shaped by a liberal consumer policy committed to freedom of choice. The introduction of individual taxation follows the goal of eliminating disincentives regarding the entry and retention of women in the labor market. The VAT system is considerably simplified. Switzerland now has only one VAT rate, which is the lowest in Europe. III. social, just and modern Switzerland - optimal opportunities for individual success The working conditions are optimal for all women and men: There are a wide variety of options for being successful and being promoted within the scope of individual possibilities. The unemployment rate is low due to economic growth as well as the willingness to perform in the education sector. Those who are unable to find a job receive the support they need to reintegrate into the labor market as soon as possible through work and education programs and appropriate incentives. Women and men can retire at age 65; in return, it ensures that people can work until age 65 Positive incentives help those who want to work voluntarily beyond the standard retirement age. The social security system, especially the pension system, has been financially stabilized in the long term. Far-sighted reforms and greatly improved economic growth ensure intergenerational equity. An additional burden on the active generation is ruled out if the freely disposable household income does not increase at the same time. Efficient and fair social insurances not only guarantee social security, but are also conducive to optimism about the future in our society. IV. Open Switzerland - a progressive, internationally networked society In an open, secure and tolerant Switzerland, all people have the same, good conditions for realizing their individual life plans; they can shape their lives freely and are not exposed to discrimination because of their choice of lifestyle. The cultural diversity of society is considered an enrichment. Equality between men and women is consistently lived out in everyday life: different wages for the same work with the same qualifications are a thing of the past. Individual taxation independent of civil status has been introduced. Child-rearing and work/career are compatible for both parents thanks to readily available childcare structures. A liberal society is characterized by openness to research and medical progress; it is aware of their importance for Switzerland as a business and science location and of the future opportunities for our population. Switzerland's relations with other countries are characterized by openness. International networking serves the country's interests and brings added security. In its relations with the European Union, Switzerland follows the bilateral path. Ongoing developments within the EU as well as Switzerland's need for further material or formal cooperation with European states are continuously analyzed. Switzerland is committed to concluding further free trade agreements outside Europe. Switzerland is actively committed to a liberal world order within the framework of international organizations, first and foremost the UN. It is doing everything in its power to further expand its host role as a location for international institutions of great importance. Switzerland is stepping up its international security policy engagement in order to make its contribution to peacekeeping and crisis prevention on the ground and thus also to stem security-related migration flows. The modernized Swiss Armed Forces align their field of action with current and future threats. By means of international networking, Switzerland and thus also the Swiss population gain in security. V. How do we get to the realization of these projects? We want to gather and mobilize liberals from all over Switzerland. We want to mobilize all liberal forces in our country. We liberals want to develop the power to get this country moving again. This strategy paper was drawn up jointly by the Presidium, the Executive Committee and the cantonal parties and unanimously adopted by the delegates of the FDP Switzerland on October 22, 2005. Now, the implementation of projects in the four areas of smart Switzerland, growing Switzerland, just Switzerland and open Switzerland is taking place. Liberal projects are launched and implemented at all levels, in municipalities, in the cantons and at the national level. I am liberal because I want Switzerland to develop into a leading growth nation. Success for me is recognition, love, material security. For me, Switzerland is Champions League in research, innovation and culture. And in tennis. I am liberal because debt makes you unfree. For me, justice is recognition and appropriate reward for performance in the economy and society. I am liberal because I want to live in the country with the highest quality of life 10 years from now. For me, responsibility is the prerequisite for the liberal order here. I am liberal because that is a prerequisite for sustainability and quality."
43420,201110,"Switzerland is strong: we live in prosperity and security. Almost everyone has a job, nor are pensions paid on time. While other countries stand on the brink of the abyss, over-indebted after the great economic crisis, our Switzerland is in a solid position thanks to prudent fiscal policy. We are top - in low crime and intact environment. The infrastructure works as precisely as a clock. These achievements cannot be taken for granted. We owe it to previous generations and to the current will of the Swiss to make their contribution to the future of our country - at work, in the family, in clubs or in politics. Switzerland's success is based on proven values Performance: Hardworking and smart people with ideas Responsibility: For yourself and with commitment to the community Courage: Improve what has been achieved and create something new Stability: Free market economy and cooperation of all forces in consociational democracy These strengths and values are more important today than ever before. Because Switzerland is facing major challenges: The world is changing - Switzerland must not stand still if we want to continue the success story for future generations. The developed countries are being challenged by the emerging economic powers of Asia: Excellent education and new skills are increasingly important. Without the Bilateral Agreements with the EU and new free trade agreements, Switzerland risks becoming economically and politically isolated. The debt and currency crisis is endangering Europe and the USA. This pressure is being felt by Switzerland as an exporting country. In our country, too, social welfare systems are in danger of collapsing under the mountain of debt if corrections are not implemented decisively in time. We must manage our landscape and natural resources responsibly without stifling the economy. Guaranteeing the safe and sustainable production and supply of energy is becoming increasingly difficult. The Swiss success story is in danger. Instead of cleverly using our advantages and tackling the challenges, politics is increasingly becoming hostage to the extreme parties. The left wants to fleece the citizens. The unrealistic SP wants to overcome the market economy. Those who perform and save are to be fleeced. It calls for a tax on inheritance and capital gains and wants to increase the value-added tax. The socialist redistribution machinery wants to subsidize a land of milk and honey with ""wages without work for all"". The SP wants to abolish the army and thus put our security at risk. Unfortunately, the general attack from the left is not being countered by a united front of the bourgeoisie: The SVP wants to seal off our country under a cheese cover. It denounces everything foreign and rejects any contribution to solving international problems. At every opportunity, it attacks the successful Bilateral Agreements - even though the people have clearly spoken out in favor of them several times. For our export country Switzerland, this is short-sighted and irresponsible. Polemics and ill will do harm. It becomes even more dangerous when the extreme parties join forces. Swiss politics is becoming a high-wire act with a constant risk of falling. Extreme parties and unholy alliances are sawing away at the pillars on which our country stands. They care less and less about government responsibility and concordance - they subordinate the interests of the country to their populist struggle with polemics and ill will for quick electoral success. Against each other instead of with each other - that is an un-Swiss motto. Since the summer of 2010, the alliance of the SP and SVP has 11th AHV revision sunk with annual savings of CHF 500 million ' Cost reductions in health care prevented ' Tens of thousands of jobs endangered with the State Treaty between Switzerland and the USA ' Army reforms blocked and thus Switzerland's security endangered ' Monetary Fund loan put at risk, Swiss interests harmed ' Without mutual respect and the willingness to openness and consensus, our unique culture of concordance will not survive. This endangers the political system - and the strengths and values that have made Switzerland successful. There is a threat of loss of prosperity and stability. There is a lot at stake in the national elections: 2011 is a directional election for our country. Because Switzerland can only continue its success story if it once again trusts in its strengths and values that have made it successful. Prosperity and stability, security and success are not to be taken for granted: the Free Liberals are fighting for them. Voters will set the course on October 23, 2011: Do they want more polemics and ill will, more deadlock and stalemate? Do they want to strengthen the extreme parties and thus harm our country? Or do they support the FDP.Die Liberalen as the liberal pole in its commitment to make Switzerland once again a country in which we work together for honest solutions? In which we uphold Swiss values and stand up against populist showdowns and ill will? As the liberal force, the Freisinnig-Liberalen fight for a modern and secure Switzerland. For a country where entrepreneurship is valued again, where everyone has a secure job - a country that does not allow social welfare systems to collapse or absurd bureaucracy. Switzerland must remain a country where everyone who is committed and takes responsibility is doing well. Every vote counts: The Swiss have it in their hands to strengthen the FDP.Die Liberalen as a constructive force - for the love of Switzerland. Switzerland depends on the will to implement genuine reforms: Liberal policies guarantee Switzerland's success as a model for future generations - just as our liberal ancestors left us prosperity and stability. This calls for honest solutions to the major challenges of the future: the FDP is tackling them. For movement instead of standstill in the interest of Switzerland. The FDP.The Liberals are fully committed to this and take responsibility - every day: our more than one thousand municipal councillors and presidents, cantonal parliamentarians and cantonal councillors, national representatives and our two federal councillors. No other party is more firmly anchored in the cantons and municipalities. Free-spirited liberals live the militia system. Commitment to the community is not lip service for them, but conviction. Switzerland is unique. The FDP is fighting to ensure that it remains so. Guarantor of the successful bilateral approach Citizens receive CHF 500 million back annually thanks to compensation for cold progression ' External childcare deductions of CHF 10,000 for children ' State treaty between Switzerland and the USA: saving tens of thousands of jobs ' Less bureaucracy for SMEs in accounting ' Withholding tax with Germany and England ' Simplification of value added tax ' Debt brake on extraordinary expenses ' Debt reduction of CHF 23 billion since 2003 ' Disability insurance financially stabilized thanks to additional financing ' Massively fewer new IV pensioners thanks to reforms ' Consensus solution for the restructuring of unemployment insurance Our 2011-2015 goals. The compass of the FDP.Die Liberalen is shaped by original liberal values: self-determination, freedom and respect. At the center of our actions is the will to perform, freedom of choice and responsibility for ourselves and our country. We are liberal in our economic policy, consistent in our financial policy and open in our social policy. We want a Switzerland in which everyone is doing well, who is honest and hardworking. Solidarity and help for self-help should be given to those who, through no fault of their own, cannot provide for themselves. We are boldly tackling those issues that require tough reforms and follow-through: Globalization, immigration, aging and the environment. We want to take responsibility for our unique Switzerland and continue to fight for more jobs, secure social services and less bureaucracy - for the love of Switzerland. So that our country and its people will be even better off in four years than they are today. FDP.Die Liberalen wants prospects for as many people in Switzerland as possible. That means first of all: work. It is not politics that creates jobs, but the large number of small, medium-sized and large companies. It is important to take care of them by providing good framework conditions. This is the core task of politics. Switzerland has weathered the biggest financial and economic crisis of recent decades well. Swiss watch, machine and drug manufacturers, as well as insurance companies and banks, are world leaders. In addition, there are thousands of SMEs, which employ two-thirds of the workforce. The FDP in Berne is more consistently committed to them than any other party - this distinction, awarded by a scientific study of the Swiss Trade Association, obliges for the future. Swiss companies and their employees remain challenged. The hard franc and new competitors from Asia and Latin America demand reforms, which the left is torpedoing with its envy debate against entrepreneurs and its fight against the market economy. In contrast, the FDP's policy enables new jobs - for the love of Switzerland. Expanding infrastructure in a targeted manner. ' Mobility is part of freedom: Congestion on rail and road pollute the environment and cost the population and companies time and money. But less mobility is the wrong answer. A dense transportation network that functions as well as Swiss clockwork is a key locational advantage. Adapting it to the needs of society is a core task of government. Preventing the energy gap: The population and the economy need affordable, environmentally friendly energy that is produced as far as possible in Switzerland. Security of supply and the increasing demand for electricity are among the major challenges of the future. Consumption is to be reduced through efficiency measures and building renovations. Renewable energies are to be promoted and hydropower is to be further expanded. Even if the replacement of existing nuclear power plants is no longer a majority option, security of supply must be guaranteed. New jobs thanks to the flexible labor market. ' No minimum wages and no permanency for trade unionists: In Switzerland, companies are rapidly creating jobs during the upswing. Young workers don't shimmy from internship to internship for years. At around 3%, unemployment is low, but must be reduced further. Wages are the highest in Europe. There is hardly any strike here. This should remain the case: Minimum wages and the de facto permanency of trade unionists are rejected. Work must be worthwhile - for parents, too. ' Improve compatibility of family and career: Women and men with children must not be forced to give up their jobs because a job is not worth it due to higher taxes, fewer health insurance subsidies and income-based daycare prices. Parents should be able to decide independently about career and family. Therefore, a tax deduction of CHF 24,000 for childcare outside the company is necessary. Reduce bureaucracy for childcare centers: You don't need a university degree to take good care of our children. Parents, not the state with courses and permits, should decide whether a daycare center is trustworthy and whether aunts, grandparents and friends are allowed to watch their children. ' Supplementary school care services: Work hours are not based on school hours. Thanks to block times and childcare services, the children are cared for, can play and learn. Bilaterals Yes - EU accession No. Thanks to the bilateral agreements, Switzerland has coped well with the crisis. Our SMEs find skilled workers and have free access to the European market. This creates jobs and prosperity. With the bilateral agreements, our country remains politically independent and economically strong. Strengthen and deepen the bilateral path. Skilled workers thanks to bilateral agreements:  Since the Bilateral Agreements in 2002, our economic growth has been top again. Europe's markets are open, the shortage of skilled workers has decreased. These people want to integrate with us. The bilaterals are our royal road, which the SVP is endangering with its provocations against the EU just as much as the SP is with its lament about the end of the bilaterals. We want to strengthen the bilateral route with the free movement of persons and further expand it in a targeted manner:  Our companies need highly qualified people from the EU. Allow specialists from third countries in a targeted manner:  Despite bilateral agreements, there is still a shortage of specialists. Where additional specialists are needed, even with intensified training of the Swiss, specialists from third countries should be admitted in a targeted manner. In addition, the best foreign students educated in Switzerland should receive a work permit and thus contribute to their education costs. The FDP wants to impose greater restrictions on the immigration of unqualified people from third countries, especially through family reunification. More economic openness, more jobs. Open future markets: In 2015, 80% of global economic growth will come from Asia and Latin America. These countries are an opportunity for Switzerland as an export country - we are the only country in Europe with an export surplus in trade with China. These markets must be opened up to our companies through WTO or free trade agreements. We must take advantage of the increasing pro-tectionism of the USA and Europe and quickly conclude free trade agreements. More performance in school. Investing in education today, secures the jobs of our youth tomorrow. ' Our most important raw material is knowledge: Our children should learn what will benefit them later in their working lives. This requires a clear performance orientation from elementary school to university, grades at all levels, kindergarten or school enrollment from the fourth year of life, and trilingualism at the end of compulsory education. Education is a priority - the FDP wants an increase in funding in the next legislature. No academization: Vocational training and higher education should be of equal value in the dual system. The academization of professions such as nursing is rejected. More training places in the natural sciences and medicine: The top position of our universities must be expanded through reforms, competition and autonomy. We also want to create more study places in the natural sciences and medicine. Innovation: Exploiting the potential of new technologies. Using environmental technologies as an opportunity: Throughout history, our society has solved problems thanks to technological progress - not thanks to bans and bureaucratic regulations. This also applies to environmental problems. Technological advances in electric mobility, new materials for building insulation and improved efficiency of renewable energies are opening up new markets for our industry and reducing the dependence of the Swiss economy on uncertain energy sources and price shocks. Driving innovation forward:  Switzerland must be strengthened as a research location. This requires sufficient funding for applied research and the National Fund and projects such as the Düben-dorf Research Park. Social security systems provide security for pensioners, the disabled and the unemployed in only a few countries. Unfundable, dishonest pension promises for tomorrow and today's debt show: Most states are facing pension collapse. Even in Germany, debt and future pension promises amount to 250% of annual economic output. Switzerland is in a better position. But here, too, gross mistakes were made: CHF 15 billion in debts to IV and CHF 8 billion to unemployment insurance led to tax increases and benefit cuts.  debts at the IV and CHF 8 billion at the unemployment insurance led to tax increases and benefit cuts. The same tragedy threatens the AHV, which will plunge into deficit in a few years. Social spending leaves the federal government with less and less money to invest in transportation, security and education, for example. Without countermeasures, the federal government will spend two out of every three tax francs on social consumption in 2025. This is where we need to pull the emergency brake and combat the pension collapse in good time. The IV shows how this works: In 2003, an FDP Federal Councilor took over the FDHA and broke the left's fierce resistance to reforms. The number of new pensioners has since been halved. Work before retirement works. This proves that consistent measures taken today will prevent the pension collapse of tomorrow - for the love of Switzerland. Save AHV from collapse. Freedom of choice in retirement age: In 2010, the SVP and SP scuttled the 11th AHV revision, which would have brought annual savings of CHF 500 million. This makes the major pension reform all the more important: everyone should be able to flexibly determine their own retirement age. Working longer should be financially rewarding. However, the scuttled 11th AHV reform shows that the major reform must not be a climbing expedition without a safety net. As a safety hook, the FDP is calling for a rapid equalization of the retirement age for men and women to 65 and a school den brake for the AHV. Getting our LOB pensions in line for the long term. Protect every employee's pension against redistribution dreams:  The second pillar contains CHF 600 billion saved by employees and employers. The money is in danger: The left wants to use it to plug holes in the AHV. Every year, CHF 600 million is redistributed from employees to BVG pensioners. The FDP wants to stop this. What is needed instead is transparency about earnings and administrative costs, more competition and freedom of choice between pension funds. Conversion and minimum interest rates should be based on life expectancy and interest rate levels rather than on political desirable variables. The increasing age deductions must be corrected, because they put older employees at a disadvantage when looking for a job. Encourage private savings through taxation. Promote saving for retirement:  The third pillar is to be further expanded and the tax allowance increased to CHF 12,000. Work instead of pension. The 6th IV revision is urgent: the remaining structural deficit of CHF 1 billion must be reduced on the expenditure side, because the temporary increase in value-added tax must be discontinued from 2018. The 6th IV revision is therefore needed quickly. In the case of the IV collection basin of ""psychogenic and milieu-active disorders"" (increase since 1986 by 900% !) there should be no pension, but only integration and health support. Pensions are to be reviewed periodically, and abuse is to be combated decisively. Reintegration: Those who can work should be able to do so. This requires tough criteria for awarding IV pensions and a commitment from companies to hire people with disabilities. Work before welfare: welfare is often more profitable than work. Because of tax exemptions and thresholds for social assistance, etc., those who work often earn less instead of receiving social assistance. This vicious circle must be broken. Social assistance is therefore taxable like wages. Stop absurd bureaucracy. For the love of Switzerland. The liberal Free Democrats have built up our state - the Left, in particular, has expanded it without measure. The FDP fought for freedom rights in the 19th century, while the left has torpedoed freedom rights such as freedom of property or freedom of trade and commerce over the last 50 years. What is needed here is countermeasures and a fundamental discussion about freedom, which is endangered in many areas by the absurd regulatory frenzy. This is the discussion the FDP wants to have. That is why we have launched a popular initiative. It gives citizens the enforceable basic right to simple, understandable laws as well as quick and unbureaucratic procedures. This also puts pressure on politicians not to call for legislation for every problem. Whether it's mandatory dog training courses or bureaucratic obstacle courses to obtain a driver's license, today the general public pays for the mistakes of individuals. More laws inflate the state and crush the freedom of the individual. But our state must set priorities. These should be determined by the Swiss - and not by the administration. Service for citizens instead of expansion of state power is the goal. Taxes must be simplified and reduced. The federal government, cantons and municipalities must limit their sprawling activities, and the administration and courts must shorten procedures. The state should confine itself to its core tasks and be efficient and strong there. This is the FDP's citizen-oriented state - for the love of Switzerland. Less and better regulation: People's initiative ""Bureaucracy Stop!"": It demands simple, understandable laws and their unbureaucratic and rapid application by the administration and courts. The government and parliament must take particular account of SMEs in their legislation. 12-point plan to reduce bureaucracy: For example, higher thresholds for the accounting obligation of SMEs, fewer requests for statistics from the state, simpler wage administration with a standard rate for social security, a standard VAT rate and a 30-day payment deadline for the state or 10% interest on arrears. Europe's simplest and lowest taxes: Coaster tax: The tax return has a place on a coaster. Limitation to three to four deductions and tax rates allow a significant reduction in tax rates. Instead of exceptions for individual groups, there should be lower tax rates for all (Easy Swiss Tax model). Lowest and simplest VAT in Europe: the single rate of 5.5% is made possible by the removal of exemptions. This reduction in bureaucracy alone creates growth of almost 1%. Less debt for future generations: ' Debt brake: Strike compliance with successful debt brake. Balanced budgets: Spending growth must not exceed economic growth. Cost reduction: Task waiver planning at the federal level in the amount of CHF 2.5 billion. With the will to take real responsibility, we fight for liberal values. Let us have the courage to find honest solutions instead of polemics and resentment. Join in! For the love of Switzerland."
43420,201510,"Future strategy Freedom, public spirit and progress - for the love of Switzerland 1. success obligates Switzerland is a model of success. Securing this is a major challenge. This requires a party that supports the state - FDP.Die Liberalen. It has made modern Switzerland possible and built it up. With its strong representation in numerous governments and parliaments, the FDP shapes Switzerland. In doing so, it focuses on freedom, public spirit and progress as core values. 2. challenges await Our country is now a world leader. Our population is better off than elsewhere in almost every area. Switzerland owes this to its liberal structure with direct democracy, federalism, a liberal economic and social order, social peace, good education, legal security and the proven relationship of trust between citizens and the state. That is our model for success. In Switzerland, every person may and can shape his or her life as freely and independently as possible. If the community is needed, problems are first solved at the municipal and cantonal level. This allows the local community to decide on their concerns. And so a variety of possible solutions emerge. This diversity is one of Switzerland's strengths. We value different language regions, world views and religions. Switzerland is located in the heart of Europe. It cannot escape this in purely geographical terms. It can only remain a world leader if it remains independent and outside the EU. But isolation is not an option. Because our country also has to face up to international developments. So far, we have been able to master these well. Will this still be true in the future with the following challenges? Europe is threatened with stagnation or even regression. Access to education, health care or the labor market is restricted. This threatens the freedom of individuals to develop according to their potential. Can we in Switzerland maintain our prosperity? The world is getting rougher. Competition among states is getting tougher. They are under pressure and are increasingly defending strategic interests. Can we manage to remain successfully independent? The world - and Switzerland - are becoming 'smaller': Internet and transport infrastructure are shrinking distances. Urbanization is increasing, environmental problems are coming into focus. Can we manage to safeguard our quality of life, which is unique in the world? Without a clear strategy for the future, Switzerland is threatened with relegation to the second division. 3. remain world leader 3.1 Freedom, public spirit and progress as the basis of our strategy Freedom, Public spirit and progress are the basis of our strategy for the future of Switzerland. Switzerland must preserve and expand freedom. Europe's crisis is an incentive to continue offering everyone the prospect of finding work thanks to performance and of shaping their own lives freely and on their own responsibility. The FDP also ensures that we can continue to determine the future of our country ourselves and directly at the ballot box and on the ground. For us, Switzerland comes first. Switzerland needs public spirit. Because this has made our country strong. The FDP wants to unite the country to overcome challenges and assert our interests as well as for jobs, secure social services and a state that is close to its citizens. A sense of community is also demonstrated by those who take responsibility for themselves and their surroundings. Switzerland needs progress. Our successful model is in danger: from the outside due to pressure from less successful states. This pressure will increase. From within because of the unholy union of socialists and backward-looking conservatives. Both are under an illusion: some see salvation in redistribution; others believe that our prosperity can be preserved without change. The FDP, however, wants progress for our country, and that means being a world leader. 3.2 Our demands for Switzerland We fight every day for the freedom to shape our lives. Every person should be able and allowed to decide for themselves how to shape their life, whether it be at work, in the family or in their free time. The state must stay out of it as long as the liberties of others are not violated. This requires citizens to exercise their freedom and the responsibility that comes with it. We make progress and public spirit possible thanks to education and research. Those who are willing to perform receive the education appropriate to their abilities. This is where the state should get involved. The same applies to government-funded basic research, which is what makes innovative entrepreneurship possible in the first place. We make family, career and community involvement compatible. Women and men should be free to choose how they realize their needs and tasks and thus their life plan. The FDP demands intelligent, self-reliant solutions: flexible working hours, mobile workplaces, equal pay. In doing so, we also strengthen the militia system, a central pillar of our civic community. The economy is all of us. It is not an end in itself, but creates jobs and prosperity. Thanks to our broad base of strong companies of all sizes in the industrial and financial sectors, we are able to withstand crises. The FDP wants the state not to interfere in the economy, but to formulate clear rules. Anyone who distorts competition, unjustly enriches themselves or illegally cheats consumers will be punished. Those who show commitment and create jobs and progress should reap the fruits of their labor and be recognized by society - even if they fail once and need a new start. We have only one Switzerland. We take care of the scarce land resources and the beauty of Switzerland's natural heritage. We solve environmental problems thanks to technological progress. We make villages and cities livable with smart solutions. We stand for a tough but fair migration policy. Switzerland is the world champion in the successful integration of foreigners. Immigrants are welcome if they respect values and the legal system and contribute to the community. Those who abuse our right of hospitality should not live in our country. We want a global, smart and consistent foreign policy. Foreign policy is interest policy. This requires a strong, united Switzerland. Located in the middle of Europe, Switzerland needs close and stable relations with the EU - thanks to the continuation of the bilateral path. This will enable Switzerland to preserve our model of political success. Switzerland is using its freedom as a non-EU country in a targeted manner and is opening up to the rest of the world. This enables our companies to conquer the world and secure jobs in Switzerland. We are creating a safe country. In our Switzerland, everyone can move safely at any time and anywhere, because safety means freedom. People and property are protected - that is central for the FDP. Therefore: Whoever violates our rules will be severely punished. We are saving Switzerland from a debt economy. We are saving the social security system from collapse. In this way, we guarantee the intergenerational contract and social cohesion. The FDP also fights for sustainable public finances and low taxes and social security contributions. In this way, the community retains freedom of action for future challenges. 4. assume responsibility We are Switzerland turbos. As the founding party of modern Switzerland, we want to keep our country on its path to success in the future. Our joint success depends on our own courage. Standing still means going backwards. Let's take responsibility: Let's keep our country at the forefront of the world with more freedom, Public spirit and progress - out of love for Switzerland."
43420,201910,"Our Switzerland - our home Moving forward together - our liberal vision Today, Switzerland is a model of success - but this cannot be taken for granted and is the result of long, hard work and the right decisions - from the liberal founders in 1848 to the present day. Switzerland is home to people who are willing to take responsibility for themselves and the community and to shape their destiny with self-confidence through diligence, respect and commitment. Switzerland is our home. Securing this successful model and carrying it into the future is the great task - of us as a party, as Freisinnige, as a country. Only in this way can we actively shape the future of Switzerland and preserve and further develop our achievements. In Switzerland, everyone assumes personal responsibility and at the same time responsibility for the community. In this way, the socially weaker are not forgotten, but supported. We fight for our freedom, respect the property of others and the interests of the general public. This liberal Switzerland is our home. This homeland is characterized by diversity and is the basis for our development as a society: it combines progress with history and tradition. Because only those who have strong roots can face the future without fear. It is anchored locally and thus allows us to think and act globally. Because that is how we will be able to maintain our independence in a networked world in the future. It creates identity in our grown diversity. Because only in this way can we, as a nation of wills, confidently shape our future. Our liberal values For us, this home is at the center of a vision for Switzerland. It is based on the liberal values of freedom, public spirit and progress: freedom means that we can shape our lives in a self-determined way. However, freedom is not limitless. We all need to take responsibility for our actions and the community. Public spirit holds Switzerland together, because it unites cultures, languages and regions. The cornerstone of public spirit is genuine solidarity and active militia work - whether through voluntary commitment in the family, neighborhood, community, association or politics. Progress is the key to prosperity today and tomorrow. Innovations and technical progress, not bans, will take us further. Our goals The following seven goals are at the heart of our vision for Switzerland so that we can move forward together as a country, nation and society, shape our future, preserve our independence and determine our lives with confidence: Diverse society with common values Diversity and social mixing for social balance. Stable intergenerational contract and flexible solutions from old-age provision, the care and health system to the design of individual employment models. Qualified migration that respects our values and legal system and contributes to our prosperity. Living solidarity that leaves no one behind Freedom and personal responsibility combined with diversity of opportunity. Volunteering for the community and functioning social balance for the most vulnerable. Lived humanitarian tradition of Switzerland with the protection for persecuted people. Economic conditions that enable, not prevent Attractive regulatory & fiscal framework and high-performance infrastructures for a liberal economic order that rewards performance. An economy that uses its freedoms responsibly and sustainably, thus avoiding government regulation. Social market economy and free competition instead of redistribution by the state. Sustainable and efficient use of space and natural resources Away from a rigid prohibition policy, towards a prudent and sustainable energy and climate policy. Safeguarding biodiversity, careful treatment of our environment and framework conditions that enable entrepreneurial agriculture. Sustainable infrastructure policy by means of more densification in already used settlement areas and better coordination of mobility and settlement policy. Strong and assertive Switzerland Comprehensive security policy with a strong militia army geared to current threat situations and all dimensions (including cyber attacks). Functioning institutions even in crisis situations. Decisively fight and prosecute crime with efficient procedures and consistent enforcement. Digitization and progress in the service of people Digitization as an opportunity for innovation and progress and for new jobs. Promote performance-based education and lifelong learning in order to be able to shape one's own future. Business as a strong partner in the research & education system. Flexible and time-adapted working time models and work structures, as well as better compatibility of family and career. Independent and networked interest policy Foreign policy is interest policy for the preservation of prosperity and security. Secure access to global markets and enable economic exchange across our borders. A strong Switzerland that makes clever use of its neutrality and sovereignty. Our understanding of the state The role of the state: People are at the center: politics and administration serve the people, and citizens have the final say through referendums and initiatives. Principle of subsidiarity: Each level of government deals only with tasks that the next lower level is not able to solve. Competence for task and financing is basically placed on the same level. The state, for its part, intervenes only where private individuals, families or communities cannot do it alone. Concentration on core tasks: The state regulates principles and refrains from overregulation. It is strong but lean and uses (tax) resources sparingly. Getting ahead together! We are the only party in Switzerland that has a positive, constructive vision for the future of our country and does not rely on fear. We want to progress as Switzerland! Together, we will ensure that our country remains successful for future generations: A Human Switzerland. An intelligent Switzerland. A brave Switzerland. A safe Switzerland. A progressive Switzerland. Because: We are the party that made this country great and created and developed all the important institutions in this country. This was only possible because we have always looked ahead and consistently worked for our country and progress. The future is an opportunity! Let's tackle them together and implement our liberal vision for the future of Switzerland. Because only together can we move forward. Secure and create jobs Jobs create prosperity and prospects. FDP.Die Liberalen is committed to Switzerland as a business and financial center. This requires better schools, lower taxes and an excellent infrastructure. The FDP fights for optimal framework conditions for all companies, a liberal economic order and a flexible labor market. So that freedom remains. External challenges Without further development by means of a framework agreement that places the bilaterals on a stable legal foundation, the bilateral path will erode. overregulation and attacks on Switzerland's liberal economic order via various popular initiatives and parliamentary initiatives. International pressure on attractive Swiss tax location for companies. Social change: new forms of living together, longer life span of the population, change in work models and forms of work. Freedom, public spirit and progress Freedom: The opportunity for a job should be open to all. Especially in economically challenging times, we fight all the harder for a competitive business location in Switzerland, which offers good conditions for SMEs as well as for large companies. We fight for the free design of labor law. This also gives young people in particular a good chance to enter the job market. The more flexible the labor regulations, the more likely it is that companies will be able to retain jobs even in economically strained times. Public spirit: Switzerland needs to train enough top talent and keep them in the workforce to meet the needs of the economy. The resource potential of a well-trained workforce must be better utilized and promoted domestically. There is untapped potential, particularly among women and older workers. This requires increased efforts for self-reliant solutions: Flexible working hours, mobile workplaces, equal pay between men and women, etc. In our liberal society, Swiss people should be able to shape their lives freely and on their own responsibility and to realize their professional potential. The militia system is a cornerstone of public spirit. Only when people get involved in associations and politics on a voluntary and unpaid basis does public spirit develop. The business community is called upon to support this commitment on the part of its employees. Progress: Digitization allows new working models, such as home office or teleworking, which make it possible to reconcile family and career: The FDP is committed to convincing the business community to enable these forms of work and to recognize the advantages for the competitiveness and attractiveness of companies. The FDP as guarantor of the bilateral path: The EU is our most important partner in economic, political and cultural terms. Switzerland is the EU's third most important trading partner. Even though the markets of the emerging countries are rapidly gaining in importance, the EU remains our most important trading partner. The bilateral path is the best of all solutions for Switzerland to maintain and further develop relations with the EU. Performance should be worthwhile: Commitment and performance for the individual must be worthwhile. We want a society of opportunity, where everyone can achieve something if he or she does so. Remuneration based on performance instead of state requirements and the dual education system with its permeability between (further) education and practice must be maintained and promoted. The FDP believes in Switzerland: The FDP is in favor of self-determined economic openness in Switzerland, because this benefits everyone. Domestically, a tough but fair migration policy must be implemented. The consistent enforcement of asylum legislation, the limitation of third-country immigration and the priority for nationals are to be implemented. But some immigration of workers capable of integration must be ensured. Our demands Liberal Economic Order: Maintaining a strong and clean Swiss industrial and financial center. Leave room for entrepreneurial freedom, personal responsibility and innovation. Liberal Labor Market: Flexible labor law without unnecessary bureaucracy and overregulation. Social partnership before blanket government requirements. Switzerland as an opportunity society in which performance pays off. More responsibility on the part of the economy: offer flexible working models, enable work-life balance, create incentives for older people to remain in the labor market longer. Maintain competitiveness: Conclusion of new free trade agreements with important sales markets. Implement AHV tax bill on a cantonal basis. Withholding tax reform to make corporate financing in Switzerland attractive again. Opportunity Society: Maintain and promote dual and permeable education pathways. Improve compatibility of family and career. Volunteer and support. Successes of the FDP.Die Liberalen Acceptance of the national AHV tax bill by the people and the cantons on May 19, 2019. Clear rejection of the left-wing initiatives on unconditional basic income, food speculation, inheritance tax. Adaptations of the Labor Code to modern conditions are underway. Low bureaucracy and optimal economic framework conditions: Various successful initiatives to curb the regulatory frenzy. Federal Council bill to increase the childcare deduction to 25,000 francs. Abolition of industrial duty proposed by the Federal Council. A smart foreign policy for an open, neutral and independent Switzerland Foreign policy is interest policy to secure prosperity, independence, security and freedom in our country. It unfolds within the framework of neutrality recognized by international law. Our companies must be able to access new markets and consolidate their existing positions. The supply of raw materials and energy is also important. Central to our jobs is access to the European Union's internal market as the most important customer of our export industry. The FDP was the only party that always supported the bilateral path with the EU without any ifs and buts. However, it rejects both EU or EEA accession and a policy of isolation. The FDP is committed to new free trade agreements with third countries in emerging economic regions. Switzerland's good offices and mediating role in conflicts must be preserved and, where necessary, strengthened. External challenges Without further development by means of a framework agreement that puts the bilateral agreements on a stable legal footing, the bilateral approach will erode. Threat to the bilateral agreements through domestic political attacks on the free movement of persons (PFZ) and Schengen. The PFZ is legally linked to the first package of bilateral agreements. Danger to the Swiss economy from international trade conflict and increasingly protectionist behavior by individual but important trading partners. Rougher international relations caused by states pursuing their strategic interests ever harder and often acting according to the principle of ""might before right""; crisis of multilateralism important for small countries (e.g. WTO). Freedom, public spirit and progress Freedom: Freedom cannot be taken for granted and must be fought for again and again. Swiss citizens should continue to be able to live and work in freedom and on their own responsibility. Sufficient jobs are an essential part of independence and thus freedom. In order for the unemployment rate to remain low, we must become more competitive in international comparison. Whether economic or fiscal policy, our freedom is built on an adaptable and independent foreign policy that sees itself as a policy of interests. Public spirit: Public spirit means taking responsibility for oneself and one's environment. This also means, however, that the will to shape itself is reflected in a foreign policy characterized by the assertion of interests. In foreign policy negotiations, Switzerland competes on an equal footing. Progress: Our country needs open markets to sell its products and services, create jobs, and provide our consumers with a wide range of choices. Economic opening leads to structural adjustments inside our country. This adjustment process must be accompanied by an appropriate foreign policy. Especially important are liberal labor laws, freedom of contract and no rampant regulation of business. The bilateral path is indispensable The FDP as guarantor of the bilateral approach: The EU is our most important partner in economic, political and cultural terms. Switzerland is the EU's third most important trading partner. Even if the markets of emerging countries are rapidly gaining in importance, the EU remains our most important trading partner. The bilateral approach is the best of all solutions for Switzerland to maintain and further develop relations with the EU. Swiss prosperity is at risk: The bilateral route guarantees Switzerland access to the internal market, creates legal certainty, strengthens competitiveness and safeguards jobs and prosperity. The FDP does not want to join the EU nor single-handed. The FDP demands that the bilateral agreements be secured and further developed. That is why we are saying yes to the framework agreement out of common sense. However, more specifics are still needed where the treaty text leaves room for interpretation - especially with regard to the EU citizenship directive and the accompanying measures. The FDP intends to defend Switzerland's interests internationally: The defense of our interests runs through cooperation. Switzerland's attractiveness as a platform for international organizations in Geneva must be improved and our seat on the IMF Executive Board preserved. A non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council and membership of the G20 are goals. Our know-how as a neutral mediator state must be exported and used in international conflicts. Our demands Foreign Policy Guarantee of an independent foreign policy that is oriented towards Switzerland's interests and secures our prosperity. Ensuring the attractiveness of Switzerland and Geneva as headquarters for international organizations. Active policy of Switzerland in international organizations. Goal: Membership in the G-20. Stronger geographic and thematic focus of international cooperation and strategic linkage of development and migration policy goals. Strengthening Switzerland's traditional mediation role in conflicts within the framework of our neutrality. Long-term foreign policy vision from which the guidelines and strategies of Swiss foreign policy can be derived. European policy Further development of the bilateral path by means of a framework agreement that secures access to the internal market in the long term and creates legal certainty; no EU accession. Preservation of Switzerland's direct democratic structures; no automatic adoption of EU law. Achieve concretizations of the basically good negotiation result on the framework agreement, in particular in the areas of the EU citizenship directive and accompanying measures. Conclusion of further bilateral agreements with the EU, such as the electricity market agreement or agreements in other areas where Switzerland has an economic interest. Foreign trade policy: Conclusion of new free trade and investment protection agreements with emerging markets in the Americas, Asia and South America. Modernization of existing free trade and investment protection agreements. Successes of the FDP.The Liberals Conclusion of free trade agreements with Japan, China, Indonesia and other emerging markets. Start of negotiations with Mercosur (including Brazil). Defense of the bilaterals against domestic political attacks: Deblockade on InstA thanks to clear positioning (""YES for reason""); defense against attacks on the free movement of persons that put the bilaterals at risk. Securing the Schengen/Dublin association thanks to pragmatic implementation of the Schengen weapons law and successful campaign against the referendum. The best education system in the world For FDP. Die Liberalen, education, research and innovation are central and closely related issues. Switzerland's success is largely based on an excellent education system that is adapted to the labor market. Innovation is a significant economic driver for our country. The FDP is committed to excellent framework and funding conditions for our education and innovation systems as well as technology transfer and the emergence of innovative companies. External challenges Maintaining the free movement of persons Equal social recognition of vocational and academic training Competition from other countries in teaching and research Academization of many professions, which leads to a shortage of skilled workers Maintaining the independence of teaching and research in academia and securing sufficient financial resources, including through support for private companies Promoting STEM fields (mathematics, information technology, natural sciences and technology) and education in national languages in order to meet the requirements of the labor market Maintaining Switzerland as a center of research, thanks in part to tax incentives Maintaining and further developing a high-performance and creative innovation system by creating the best framework conditions for research and company start-ups Freedom, public spirit and progress Freedom: Each person must be free to choose the type of education, the course and the organization of their studies. Equal opportunity is central to education and enables social advancement. Linking business and society is critical to innovation. Prejudices against vocational education must be reduced and the appreciation of this branch of education must be improved. Permeability between educational programs must be improved. The independence of universities and research institutions must be preserved vis-à-vis politicians and public authorities. Collaboration and synergies between research institutions and the private sector enable the success of our companies and the prosperity of society as a whole. In addition, our education system is open to all career paths thanks to the permeability between academic and vocational education. Public spirit: The educational landscape in Switzerland is characterized by a high level of public schools and equal opportunities, which (thanks to scholarships, among other things) enable social mobility. The dual education system ensures low unemployment rates and a sound education for everyone who shows commitment. Today, Switzerland is in constant competition at the international level. The framework conditions for education and innovation must be improved; this is the only way to secure the future. Progress: Innovation is the real key to Swiss success. The foundations for this are cooperation between research institutions and companies as well as excellently trained specialists at all levels. Education must be able to maintain its high level. The harmonization of curricula must be further improved. Similarly, education in STEM fields must be promoted, including by raising awareness of technical and scientific fields among women. Finally, exchanges between the academic and business worlds must be strengthened to encourage technology transfer and the emergence of innovative companies. In particular, thanks to the specialists who have a degree in higher vocational education and are thus closely linked to practice, many innovations come about. Switzerland is a model of success: In an international comparison, Switzerland is among the best in the areas of education, research, development and innovation. This is directly reflected in the record low (youth) unemployment. The Swiss success model is characterized in particular by the cooperation between business and the authorities and by an excellent standard. Two-thirds of school graduates do an apprenticeship and 70% of these young people are trained by SMEs. The occupational profiles apply throughout Switzerland and the training commitment of the companies is ensured by the organizations responsible for training and examinations in the world of work (OdA). But the Swiss model is in danger: International competition in education (especially at the tertiary level) and in research and development is becoming increasingly fierce. The academization of titles in higher vocational education is also a danger: the steady increase in the number of diplomas required for employment penalizes vocational training. Our demands Education: Preservation and further development of Switzerland's excellent education system, both at the university level and in vocational training Combating superfluous academization Promoting STEM fields among young people and women Supporting basic and continuing education, namely through tax deductions Harmonization of curricula at the Swiss level (HarmoS Concordat) Long-term solution for student and researcher exchanges Successor program to Erasmus+ from 2021, independent programs Vocational and academic education must be treated as equivalent career paths. The influence of the OdA in vocational education and training must be maintained and strengthened. Innovation: Maintain and develop the framework conditions favoring innovation and entrepreneurship, namely through tax breaks for investments. Ensuring freedom and independence in research. Upgrading cooperation between companies, research institutions and universities. Better coordinated cooperation between CTI and SNSF and optimization of technology transfer. Consolidate Switzerland's business-oriented innovation park and strengthen the country's attractiveness for talent. Improve incentive systems (namely taxation) to encourage research. Creation of an innovation fund fed by private money. Active and successful participation in Horizon 2020 and its successor program Horizon Europe (2021-2027). Advantageous student exchange by means of transitional solution for Erasmus+, aiming at full participation in the successor program of Erasmus+. Strengthening higher vocational education as a powerful driver of business innovation. Successes of the FDP.The Liberals Strong elementary schools that offer equal starting opportunities for all Low youth unemployment thanks to practice-oriented vocational training World-leading universities and research institutes Stable funding for education, research and innovation Tax deduction for education and training costs Active support for the skilled labor initiative by promoting STEM fields Alignment of school systems, common educational goals and performance standards Upgrading the learning of national languages to strengthen national cohesion Transitional solution for joining EU research program Horizon 2020 Reduce bureaucracy - we fight every day for the freedom to shape our lives Absurd bureaucracy with a flood of paragraphs and prohibitions restricts our freedom. Life design, personal initiative and entrepreneurship are hindered. We want simple rules and transparent and simple procedures. Unnecessary bans, paternalism, bureaucracy and the flood of complaints are a thorn in our side. Instead of always introducing new laws, the existing laws should be consistently enforced. External challenges Society is tending toward more and more government control instead of personal responsibility. State as educator with increasing intervention in the private and economic lives of citizens - e.g. in finance, education, lifestyle and health. Increasing centralization of regulations in solving real or apparent problems; softening of federalism. A delicate balance in surveillance and data protection between the need for security and the protection of privacy. Freedom, public spirit and progress Freedom: Freedom allows us to shape our own lives. This freedom is being undermined more and more. The state is increasingly trying to squeeze citizens into norm-citizen templates. The FDP is opposed to this. All should be free to live their lives as long as they preserve the freedom of others. At the same time, there is a danger that parts of the population will voluntarily cede their freedom to the state. They seem to be weary of the obligation to make decisions that comes with freedom. An increasing culture of envy promotes uniformity and thus destroys the power and diversity of freedom. The FDP is fighting against this and is committed to shaping lives in freedom instead of under state tutelage. Public spirit: Freedom obliges us to take responsibility for ourselves and the community. Responsibility is the foundation of a free society. When private individuals, politicians and companies fail to take responsibility for themselves, the community and the environment, the call for more government follows. The FDP therefore calls for adherence to Swiss values such as modesty and service to the community and calls on companies to support the militia system. At the same time, the FDP fights state interference, for example in childcare with mandatory childcare courses for relatives. Individual initiative and neighborly help should be possible in an uncomplicated way. In Switzerland, people solve problems together instead of calling on the state for help. Progress: Prohibitions on thinking will not bring Switzerland any further. In order to contribute to and make better use of progress, we need non-bureaucratic research opportunities. The FDP stands for progress that increases the opportunities for individuals to shape their lives. Privacy is protected. Switzerland is a model of success: Switzerland owes its prosperity to its liberal structure, federalism and the principle of tackling challenges where they arise. National solutions only come into play if they bring added value to the people. This has led to diverse opportunities for development and life design. We live cultural diversity and know that thanks to federalism, problems are solved where they exist. Switzerland does not need a strong nation state, we live diversity in unity. Performance must be worthwhile: Often, committed, aspiring entrepreneurs shy away from implementing their ideas because they are afraid of the impending bureaucratic hurdles. It is not acceptable for companies to abandon apprenticeship training, for example, because the expense has reached an intolerable level. The administrative burden on companies must be reduced wherever possible. Our demands Fight absurd bureaucracy Culture of personal responsibility instead of over-regulation (no aunt regulation or sugar tax). Basic right for citizens to understandable, simple and efficient laws. Unbureaucratic and rapid application of the law by the administration and courts. Relief for companies: Simpler payroll administration, liberalization of working time recording and regulations. Encourage self-reliance and entrepreneurship instead of stifling it with formalities. Use digitization for the benefit of companies (electronic signature, one-stop store). Europe's simplest tax system: Tax return on a beer mat (Swiss Easy Tax): Massive simplification of the tax system. Introduction of individual taxation. Europe's lowest and simplest VAT. Streamlining the federal budget curb expenditure growth and therefore regularly review government tasks. Independent regulatory impact review authority and regulatory brake on overpriced projects. Successes of the FDP.The Liberals The labor law is currently being adapted to modern conditions. Low bureaucracy and optimal economic framework conditions: Various successful initiatives to curb the regulatory frenzy. Electronic identity (e-ID) finally being implemented. Adopted motion to avoid duplication of data collection thanks to digitization. Flexibility in the refund of withholding tax. Modernization of customs procedures; abolition of industrial tariffs proposed by the Federal Council. More sustainable energy policy In energy policy, the security of supply for people and companies must have absolute priority. At the same time, energy use and electricity production must be as CO2-neutral as possible. This can only be achieved efficiently and ecologically if Switzerland's energy supply is guaranteed in as market-based a manner as possible. FDP.Die Liberalen relies on reliable framework conditions and deregulation instead of new taxes and subsidies. There is a need to move away from subsidy systems towards flexible, market-based and internationally regulated solutions that promote competition. External challenges Substitution of fossil fuels with renewables and increased electrification. Calls for subsidies, state intervention and market foreclosure are on the rise. Implementation of the goals of the first package of measures of the Energy Strategy 2050. Demands for renewable energies compete with nature and monument protection. Access to the European electricity market is blocked: Delay in full electricity market opening and in concluding the electricity agreement with the EU. Drastic changes in the European electricity market: foreseeable supply difficulties in winter months. Increasing grid loads due to more decentralized electricity production. Freedom, public spirit and progress Freedom: The electricity market must finally be fully opened up so that consumers can freely choose their electricity supplier and benefit from more favorable tariffs. The electricity agreement with the EU must be implemented in a beneficial manner. It should enable us to integrate into the European internal electricity market and participate in it on an equal footing. This will make an important contribution to Switzerland's secure electricity supply, especially in the winter months. Public spirit: The FDP wants to strengthen Switzerland's energy security without increasing CO2 emissions. The aim is not to achieve a self-sufficient supply for Switzerland, but to clearly define the necessary domestic electricity production capacities in the sense of a strategic reserve, supplemented by electricity imports. An increasing interconnection of the electricity, heat and mobility sectors and a joint consideration of electricity, gas and heat networks are to be included in these considerations. In addition, regulatory improvements are needed in favor of self-consumers. Progress: Switzerland's building stock is responsible for about 45% of total energy consumption. An inventory shows that this is where the greatest potential for greater energy efficiency lies and needs to be exploited. This requires a higher renovation rate by improving the building program and making renovation costs tax deductible. We need to focus on new technologies and have confidence in technological progress. This applies in particular to the areas of energy production, consumption, storage and the grid infrastructure, where significant efficiency gains can be achieved thanks to digitization. We reject prohibitions on thinking and technology. More market: Following the adoption of the first package of measures of the Energy Strategy 2050 and the resulting decision to limit subsidy models such as the cost-covering feed-in tariff (KEV), models that are as close to the market as possible are now needed to achieve the targets. For the electricity market, we are striving for a technology-neutral solution that requires as little government intervention as possible, prevents windfall profits, and in which the various players behave in a market economy. An important part of this is making the water rate more flexible to make hydropower more competitive. More market is also needed in metering, which is to be fully liberalized. This allows economies of scale to be achieved, costs to be reduced and space to be created for innovative solutions. Our demands Exploiting existing potential Energy retrofit of building stock through energy efficiency standards and tax incentives. Improve impact and utilization of the building program. Accelerated deployment of intelligent control and measurement instruments (smart meters). Efficiency improvement in vehicles through CO2 limits in accordance with European standards. Energy pricing in line with the market Ensure abolition of subsidies through KEV and one-off payments. Expansion of target agreement systems for greater energy efficiency and CO2 reduction. Introduction of a flexible and market-oriented water rate model. Complete liberalization of metrology. Implement a technology-neutral, close-to-market model for the electricity market. Ensure security of supply for Switzerland Define the security of supply and the responsibilities of the various actors. Complete electricity market liberalization (freedom of choice for consumers and SMEs). Advantageous integration of Switzerland into the EU's internal energy market. Enable progress Neither technology bans nor technology bids. Expand existing and explore new types of electricity production and storage technologies. Expanding and upgrading the smart grid infrastructure and ensuring grid stability. Successes of the FDP.The Liberals Successful abolition / time limitation of subsidies in the energy sector. Introduction of tax incentives in favor of energy-efficient building renovations. Accelerating the conversion and expansion of power grids. Various FDP motions referred to the Federal Council by Parliament: to expand, simplify and standardize the exemption mechanisms (target agreement systems) from the CO2 levy and the grid surcharge, for the complete liberalization of the electricity market, to improve energy efficiency, to create good conditions for geothermal projects, for the reduction of bureaucracy in the field of renewable energies Freedom family and social policy In our liberal society, women and men should be able to shape their lives freely and on their own responsibility within the framework of community rules. Equal opportunities for all at the start and freedom to try something new: This allows people to use their own potential and make their contribution to the development of Switzerland. Equal opportunity is the cornerstone of liberal family and social policies. A free choice of family model and childcare requires appropriate framework conditions. In order for the Swiss population to be able to decide on their own retirement age in the future, a flexible reference age and sustainable financing of old-age provision are needed. External challenges Increasing burden on families and SMEs due to taxes, levies and regulations Returning to work for women after taking a break to have children Compatibility of family and career Re-entry of the 50+ generation after loss of employment Declining working population despite increasing female labor force participation Demographic change in society. The population is getting older and staying healthy longer Freedom, public spirit and progress Freedom: A liberal policy puts people at the center and allows every woman and man to choose their goals from a variety of options. Freedom of choice and development, together with equal opportunity, are important prerequisites for balancing family and work and for community engagement. All family forms need framework conditions that treat all models equally and a working world in which family and career are compatible. Those who want to work should be able to do so. Public spirit: The compatibility of family, career and commitment to the community is a prerequisite for the implementation of a sense of community: The unpaid commitment to our community, whether in politics, clubs, neighborhood assistance or family, has made our country strong. Only if we can preserve militia activity will the successful Swiss model have a future. Flexible working models promote militia work and enable a sense of community. Each phase of life places its own demands on work design. Technological advances make it easier for parents to respond to children's development. To improve the situation of women in the labor market and meet the need of many men for part-time work, regulatory barriers must be removed and companies must create flexible and versatile working conditions. In this way, the shortage of skilled workers can be alleviated and Switzerland will be less dependent on foreign skilled workers in the medium term. Progress: Switzerland still has some catching up to do in the area of work-life balance. Some of the supporting structures lag behind social change. However, regional needs vary. Day structures such as lunch tables, task supervision or coordinated schedules allow for the compatibility of family and career. Financing models such as childcare vouchers allow structures to be created where parents need them. Parents' common sense must be trusted again and bureaucracy must be reduced. Private solutions should be encouraged and not hindered by unnecessary government regulation. Better conditions for older employees: Switzerland is at the top of the international league table in terms of statutory and actual retirement age, with more than a third of the workforce continuing to work part-time after retirement. Many more would work longer if there were more part-time positions. Our labor market allows us to create a sustainable competitive advantage for older employees and the location thanks to good models. For older employees, on the one hand, the retirement age needs to be made more flexible and employers need to create incentives to remain in the workforce longer. On the other hand, a cultural change is needed to keep older employees in the labor market even before retirement: Prejudices and discrimination on the part of the economy, lifelong learning and proportional wage claims on the part of the employees. Our demands No unequal treatment of certain life and/or family models: Introduction of individual taxation. Opening marriage to same-sex couples including access to reproductive medicine resources. Improve work-life balance for both parents: Introduction of modern parental leave (16-week parental leave: 8 weeks reserved for mothers, the rest to be freely shared between the parents). Increase the tax deduction for external childcare costs to 25,000 francs/year. Creation of sufficient childcare facilities by cantons and municipalities (day structures such as day schools, lunch tables, task assistance or marginal hour care). Financing models for external care that create structures where parents need them (e.g., childcare credits). Equal footing for private and public daycare centers. Less bureaucracy and more freedom for independent solutions. Promote more flexible work models such as part-time positions, job sharing, telecommuting and home office by reducing regulatory hurdles. Integration of older employees into the labor market More active, specialized and personalized support for unemployed older workers by the regional employment service should enable rapid reintegration into the labor market. Making the retirement age more flexible and improving incentives to remain in the labor market. Increase tax deductions for continuing education. Successes of the FDP.The Liberals Tax deductions for external childcare: The National Council and Council of States have already approved an increase in deductions to CHF 25,000. Introduction of maternity compensation (""Triponez model"") Federal law on registered partnership of same-sex couples Possibility of stepchild adoption for partners living in registered partnership and de facto cohabitation Elimination of bureaucratic hurdles for the construction and operation of daycare centers for children Financial and tax policy We are fighting for Western Europe's simplest and lowest taxes for citizens and businesses. Only when citizens can spend the majority of their wages themselves do they become involved in the community. An attractive tax system encourages entrepreneurship. The most important management tool in fiscal policy is the debt brake. External challenges Constantly increasing tasks and expenditures lead to tax increases as well as new fees and charges for citizens and companies. International pressure from OECD (BEBS) and EU on the Swiss tax regime and thus on the competitiveness of our companies. Over-regulation and government interference in privacy and entrepreneurship. Freedom, public spirit and progress Freedom: Tax competition must be preserved so that taxpayers can also vote with their feet and move away. The special relationship of trust between citizens and the state must be preserved. The financial privacy of the individual must not be touched for the domestic relationship, irrespective of the enforcement of international norms. Public spirit: Maintaining the quality of life and attractiveness of Switzerland is a common goal of our citizens and resident companies. Particularly in uncertain and challenging times of strong francs, simple and low taxes make a significant contribution to Switzerland being valued as a center of life and a location. Moreover, only those who can spend the majority of their wages themselves are interested and committed to the community. Healthy public finances do not burden future generations. Progress: Especially with international pressure, new ways must be found to shape the tax system. Reform of the tax system must be open to new ideas such as individual taxation and bring simplifications. The tax return should fit on a beer mat. Switzerland is a model of success: The proven tax competition between cantons and municipalities must be maintained. It forces them to keep their spending policies in check. Switzerland must remain an attractive location in terms of taxation, because this is the only way to secure our economic growth, our quality of life and our jobs. The deep public debt must not be increased with further spending. Performance must be worthwhile: Those who work and save should not be penalized. Work and performance must be worthwhile. Low income and wealth taxes are the right signal. The FDP believes in Switzerland: Our country is competitive, has a functioning economy and a low debt ratio. The advantages must be preserved. In the international forums on corporate taxation and tax competition, Switzerland must assert itself and defend its peculiarities where possible. Our demands Simple and reasonable taxes for citizens: Europe's simplest income tax. Individual taxation for everyone based on their income. Offsetting real progression (i.e., ongoing tax increases as the economy grows). No capital gains tax and no even higher burden on high incomes and assets. Simplest and lowest value added tax in Europe of six percent. Low and simple taxes for companies: Reform of the withholding tax to make corporate financing in Switzerland attractive again. Staggered elimination of issuance taxes on equity, insurance stamps, and sales tax. Implementation of the AHV tax bill in the cantons. A lean and strong state: No unnecessary regulations and government intervention. Federal spending must be reviewed consistently and on an ongoing basis. Debt brake in social security. Surpluses in the federal budget are to be used for debt reduction. Structural reforms instead of short-term stimulus programs. Successes of the FDP.The Liberals Adoption of the national AHV tax bill by the people and cantons on May 19, 2019. Introduction and retention of the debt brake against opposition from the center-left and the Federal Council. Federal Council proposal to increase the childcare deduction to CHF 25,000. More flexibility in the refund of withholding taxes. Compensation for cold progression. Clear rejection of the national inheritance tax. Quality competition for a healthy Switzerland The Swiss healthcare system offers a comprehensive range of services and the level of satisfaction among the population is high. Life expectancy and quality are continuously increasing. Unlike abroad, our health care system is debt-free. Every patient has access to state-of-the-art medical treatments. But this has its price. Regulated competition must increase quality and reduce costs. By reducing current disincentives, providers who treat patients as efficiently as possible will be rewarded in the future. The FDP wants a high-quality healthcare system in which freedom of choice is guaranteed. Its financing must be sustainable and all stakeholders must assume their responsibilities. External challenges Growing proportion of elderly population and rising costs. Expansion of volumes by health care providers and limitless expectations on the part of certain patients. Increasing planned economy tendencies of the authorities. A welcome medical advance, but one that comes at a cost. Freedom, public spirit and progress Freedom: People in Switzerland can rely on a high-quality healthcare system in the event of illness. Health insurance guarantees that even the consequences of serious illness remain financially bearable. Security liberates and thus creates space for new opportunities - for individuals and for companies. Public spirit: In Switzerland, every patient has access to the most modern medical treatments and premium reductions ensure that everyone can afford the costs. The compulsory system prevents people from foregoing insurance coverage out of short-term calculation or economic compulsion and passing on their costs to the general public in the event of illness. But the FDP wants more personal responsibility so that the costs remain affordable for everyone. What is needed is a return to the core of solidarity: financial assistance when patients can no longer bear the costs of basic health services themselves. Progress: The state must give the industry room to maneuver so that innovation can be unleashed. The FDP fights to preserve access to medical progress and choice among innovative care models. The framework conditions for research and development must be constantly improved compared to foreign competitors so that Switzerland remains attractive as a center of innovation. Performance should be rewarded: Regulated competition in the healthcare sector aims to increase the quality of services and reduce costs. The patient has a right to know the quality of treatment provided by health care providers. The FDP wants real freedom of choice and quality competition. Cutting-edge medicine should be provided where competition ensures it best and most efficiently - not where a bureaucrat places it. We reject a planned economy and monopolies. The FDP believes in Switzerland: Abroad, the planned economy has led to compromised quality, waiting periods, and delayed introduction of new therapies rather than cost savings. The current Swiss system is good, but needs to be improved with targeted reforms. Our healthcare system is also an investment for the national economy: Fewer and shorter absences due to illness are in the interest of both the patient and the company. Our demands Quality competition instead of planned economy Quality ratings enable true freedom of choice for patients. Competition improves quality. Cutting-edge medicine is practiced where the quality is proven to be right. A variety of insurance and care models guarantees freedom of choice for customers and patients. No further nationalization of health care. Only those service providers should be allowed to bill under the KVG who treat patients effectively, appropriately and economically (WZW criteria). Quality measurement and appeal options ensure balanced and high-quality care. Public spirit and personal responsibility Ensure rapid access to state-of-the-art medicine for all. Innovation instead of rationing. No abolition of the mandatory health insurance plan including premium reductions for the economically needy. Optimization of the current system instead of introducing a watering can system. Personal responsibility ensures that costs do not explode - no overstretching of solidarity through wage-dependent premiums or deductibles. Regular adjustment of the deductibles to the cost development. Examine the introduction of new instruments (""health account"") to ensure the long-term financing of our health care system. Unleashing innovation - correcting misaligned incentives: Leave room for entrepreneurial freedom, personal responsibility and innovation. Strengthen the industry by incentivizing innovation and adoption of advanced technologies (e-health). Preventing the academization of nursing professions. Disentangle the multiple roles of the cantons: focus on regulation and enforcement. Transparent and Uniform Funding Flows in Outpatient and Inpatient Medicine (EFAS). The contract partners and the supervisory authority ensure that the tariffs are regularly adjusted and that the artificial inflation of the volume of services is combated. Successes of the FDP.The Liberals Prices for original drugs have fallen to the level of comparable countries after seven years of FDP leadership in the DHA. From 2011, the price reduction will amount to 450 - 650 million Swiss francs per year. Refinement of risk equalization and definitive anchoring in law. Rejection of the single health insurance fund (by popular vote and a majority of the cantons) and prevention of a high-risk pool in the KVG. Timely improvement of the supervision of health insurance, without an overbearing new central supervisory authority that crushes the market. Maintaining discounts for the higher deductibles. BR Berset wanted to reduce the discounts, which benefit the insured who take a higher financial risk with a high deductible. Retention of current premium regions. BR Berset presented a bill that would have led to the subsidization of urban by rural areas. This project has failed. The current premium regions will be maintained. Optimal infrastructure Switzerland's infrastructures are among the best developed in the world. They are the foundation of a healthy economy and a well-functioning society. But they are increasingly reaching their capacity limits. Transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructures must therefore be maintained at a top level, used more efficiently and expanded where necessary. We need networked solutions between all modes of transport and spatial planning. External challenges Growing commuter flows, overcrowded trains and congested roads at rush hours and between centers, but below-average overall utilization of public transportation. Too little capacity at state airports. Displacement of freight traffic by passenger traffic. Increasing financing requirements for new construction, expansion and maintenance of transport infrastructures. High regulatory hurdles and social resistance hinder the rapid renewal and expansion of the telecommunications infrastructure. Scarce land resources: housing shortage in centers, spread of agglomerations, loss of cultural space in rural areas. Freedom, public spirit and progress Freedom: Mobility is central to Switzerland as a tourist destination and business location, both domestically and abroad. That is why freight transport, especially on the railways, must not be further displaced by passenger transport. Airports are also infrastructures of national importance and should be allowed to continue growing. At the same time, location-independent working also means freedom and relieves the strain on transport infrastructures. This requires high-performance telecommunications infrastructures both in the centers and in rural areas. Public spirit: Well-developed transport and telecommunications infrastructures right into the peripheral regions contribute to the cohesion of our country. There must be no digital divide between cities and peripheral regions. The conversion and expansion as well as the financing of the existing transport infrastructures are secured in the long term. The benefits of investments must be clear to users and the community. Conversely, users must participate more in financing, especially in public transport, so that the cost recovery ratio is increased. Progress: If networked solutions are implemented between all modes of transport, high infrastructure investments are sustainable. After completion of the NRLA, a Swiss rail transport hub is to be created through optimization and expansion on the west-east axis. New payment concepts for the use of transport infrastructures can help to ensure that financing is more sustainable and more in line with the polluter-pays principle. We are one country: In the future, the expansion of transport infrastructures must be better coordinated with spatial planning. First and foremost, expansion is to take place where the transport infrastructure already exists and/or can be expanded relatively easily. Land resources must be used sparingly in both urban and rural areas. Demand-responsive and dense construction provides protection against urban sprawl and thus protects intact nature. With the full implementation of the first stage of the Spatial Planning Act, inward settlement development must be promoted. At the same time, clearer rules are needed for building outside the construction zones. Today's absolute position of homeland and monument protection must also be reconsidered. To continue to enable private residential investment, building codes must be simplified. Government-subsidized housing must benefit only those truly in need. Exploiting the opportunities of digitization: An excellent infrastructure is the basic prerequisite for making the most of the opportunities offered by digitization, for example in autonomous driving. It must therefore be made fit for the digital world. For the implementation of 5G in particular, a better regulatory framework is needed to drive forward the conversion and expansion of the mobile communications infrastructure. However, the focus is not only on traditional telecommunications and mobile networks, but also on electricity networks, for example. Investments in expansion and maintenance must not be slowed down by regulation and must enable the efficient use of existing infrastructures. Regulatory intervention must also not be pre-emptive, as in the case of the legal anchoring of network neutrality. Our demands Railroad: Improvement of the network throughout the country (capacity and speed) to create a rail transport hub Switzerland. Eliminate bottlenecks by increasing capacity and - where possible - increase service density (especially on the west-east axis). Increased user funding, taking into account attractive pricing. Strengthening rail freight transport vis-à-vis passenger transport. Street: Investments in agglomeration infrastructure. More optimal use of traffic areas by all modes of transport in favor of liquefaction and traffic safety (overall concept in road traffic incl. non-motorized traffic). Elimination of bottlenecks through capacity expansions or new construction and better coordination between cantonal and national roads. Rapid completion of the national road network. Creating the regulatory prerequisite for autonomous driving. Aviation & Shipping: Strengthening the place of national airports as infrastructure of national importance. Ensure funding for air traffic control at regional airports & no more fees. Better framework conditions for freight transport in aviation & shipping by providing the necessary capacities. Telecommunications: Implement 5G: Better framework conditions for the rapid conversion & expansion of mobile networks (adaptation of installation definitions, relaxation of limits for mobile antennas, etc.). Avoidance of lengthy legal proceedings and interventions by authorities (e.g., expansion of fiber-optic network). Do not hamper digitization with premature regulation, e.g., with regard to network neutrality. Spatial Planning: Matching residential growth with new transportation infrastructure construction. Promote inward settlement development and regulate building outside the building zones more clearly. Reconsider absolute status of homeland and historic preservation. Demand-responsive housing construction by reducing or simplifying building codes. Government subsidized housing only for those truly in need. Successes of the FDP.The Liberals Successful, long-term financing of rail infrastructure through FABI. Sustainable financing of road transport infrastructure and more funds for the elimination of bottlenecks through initiated compromise on the National Road and Agglomeration Transport Fund (NAF). Renovation of the Gotthard road tunnel with a second tunnel tube. Various FDP motions submitted to parliament or already referred to the Federal Council: // to improve the framework conditions for mobile telephony and better mobile telephony coverage, for better regulatory conditions for Switzerland as an aviation location, for a coordinated expansion of transport infrastructures, for an overall concept in road traffic (incl. non-motorized traffic), in favor of legal certainty on national roads (passing within the law), Liberal environmental and climate policy It is the responsibility of all of us to ensure that future generations have a well-preserved, natural basis for life. The effects of our actions, such as climate change and dwindling biodiversity, are a significant challenge in this regard. For us, they are a mission that we approach with appropriate determination. However, targeted measures must always be ecologically, economically and socially sustainable. Only in this way can they be effective, affordable and acceptable to the people. We can only achieve this goal with innovation, progress and good framework conditions, not with rigid prohibitionist policies. Thus, a liberal environmental policy is also economic policy. Such a liberal environmental policy is an opportunity for society and the economy. External challenges Climate change and its consequences such as receding glaciers, increased weather extremes, etc. Decreasing animal and plant diversity (declining biodiversity). Extreme calls for net zero emissions by 2030 or declaring a climate emergency. Mandatory implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement. Switzerland's heavy dependence on fossil fuels in industry, buildings and transport. Long renewal cycles in the building stock or in the automotive sector. Freedom, public spirit and progress Freedom: Personal responsibility and freedom guide us. We rely on the innovative power and creativity of the people and companies involved. In order to make the right decisions as freely as possible, the right regulatory framework is needed. Thus, in favor of densification, it needs further simplification of building regulations. Or regulatory barriers to building renovation, e.g., in landlord-tenant law or homeland/historic preservation, must be consistently dismantled. In order for companies to be able to contribute their share as freely as possible, international creditability must be guaranteed by a mandatory set of rules. This is the only way to guarantee effective emission reductions abroad and the correct trading of emission certificates. Public spirit: Current and future generations have a right to well preserved livelihoods. However, these are under increasing pressure due to climate change and dwindling biodiversity. If we do nothing today, the consequences will limit future generations. This contradicts the liberal value of public spirit and the principle of intergenerational justice. In order for people to do their part, they need more transparency regarding the CO2 emissions of their actions, e.g. in the consumption of food or the use of transportation. In addition to transparency, cost truthfulness is equally important, otherwise the limits of individual freedom will not be apparent. This applies in particular to transport. With an incentive tax on fossil fuels, as part of an overall concept for infrastructure financing, and airline tickets, the costs of our own trade can be better reflected and a contribution made to reducing emissions. Just as important, however, is the continuation of the CO2 tax on fuels in the building sector. Progress: Liberal environmental and climate policy is characterized by a belief in progress driven by research and innovation. This requires technology neutrality, functioning markets and competition for ideas. Technological innovations should, for example, contribute to more efficient or resource-saving food production. However, progress is also needed in housing by means of building automation so that energy consumption can be reduced. This also applies to companies that could achieve significant efficiency gains, for example, through increased sector coupling. Great potential lies in new technologies for CO2 removal from the atmosphere or seasonal storage of electricity. Innovations must also be driven forward in transport so that CO2-neutral forms of transport in the air and on land are developed and implemented more quickly. More market: Effective environmental policy is above all also economic policy. Because only together with the economy can we take effective measures in favor of the environment. So instead of relying solely on new subsidy instruments or bans, market-based instruments must be used to a greater extent. This is why the expansion of the emissions trading system via the link between the EU and Switzerland is so important. Another key issue is the complete opening of the electricity market, which is a prerequisite for an electricity agreement with the EU. On the other hand, this would increase competition between suppliers, creating new, more innovative renewable energy products and increasing efficiency in the system. More market is also needed in waste management by breaking up state monopolies and allowing even more private-sector, innovative solutions to emerge in favor of the circular economy. Our demands care for nature and landscape Eliminate false incentives and misregulation in food production & deploy new modes of production in favor of more efficient use of natural resources. Promote inward settlement development and regulate building outside building zones more clearly. Implement biodiversity strategy through mandatory tools and periodic impact assessments. Align direct payments more closely with ecological goals such as the promotion of biodiversity. Mandatorily reduce use of pesticides and ban particularly harmful ones. Refurbish buildings and increase energy efficiency Reduce regulatory barriers to redevelopment (e.g., landlord-tenant law or homeland/historic preservation). Reduce energy consumption in housing by means of building automation. Accelerate energy refurbishment of buildings through CO2 limits and tax incentives. Optimize the impact and utilization of the building program. Continue CO2 abatement levy on fuels and improve redistribution. Enable ecological economy Pursue the creation of a mandatory, international set of rules for the recognition of emission reductions and the trading of emission certificates. Advance the circular economy by abolishing misregulation (e.g. in waste management) and breaking up existing monopolies. Expand investments in R&D for the benefit of environmental and climate protection in a practical manner. Ensure linkage of the Swiss and EU emissions trading systems. Expand target agreement systems to as many companies and industries as possible. Driving forward innovative and climate-friendly mobility Promote low-carbon mobility by providing infrastructure and using digital transport services. Increase transparency in air traffic by specifying CO2 emissions per flight. Continue CO2 target values for passenger cars and vans in accordance with the EU reduction rate. Gradually introduce an incentive tax on fossil fuels that is redistributed and incorporates existing taxes into an overall concept. Introduce incentive tax on airline tickets for innovation and climate protection. Successes of the FDP.The Liberals Introduction of tax incentives in favor of energy-efficient building renovations in the first package of measures of the Energy Strategy 2050. Expansion, simplification and standardization of the target agreement systems (individual CO2 reduction obligations for companies). Integration of aviation into the European emissions trading system without duplicating the burden of other international CO2 compensation systems (e.g. CORSIA). Mandatory mandate for the Federal Council to fully open the electricity market. Immigration policy: Tough but fair The Swiss are concerned about demographic developments and strong immigration. Immigration policy and relations with the European Union are among the FDP.Die Liberalen's major priorities. It is important that Switzerland can continue to count on highly qualified workers from abroad in the future. At the same time, we want to decisively counter the abuses and negative effects: combat social tourism, restrict immigration from third countries and remedy abuses in the asylum sector. External challenges Domestic political attacks on the Bilaterals, the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons (FMPA) and Schengen/Dublin. Significant immigration from third countries. Implement the restructuring of the asylum sector. Reducing abuses of the asylum system in Switzerland. Freedom, public spirit and progress Freedom: Swiss companies must continue to be able to count on the foreign skilled workers they need. It must be ensured that Swiss nationals continue to have the opportunity to go to the European Union to work or study. The FMPA termination initiative should be rejected because it does not solve the real problems in the migration sector. Switzerland is independent and decides alone - in accordance with international treaties - on the conditions of admission and settlement of foreigners in Switzerland. New readmission agreements for the repatriation of rejected asylum seekers are necessary and should be supported. Public spirit: The shortage of skilled workers from people living in Switzerland has made Switzerland an immigration country. Well-integrated migrants have always been an important part of Swiss society. This immigration takes place via three routes: Firstly, via the free movement of persons with the EU/EFTA states. Second, through immigration from third countries. Third, on asylum. The Swiss population is calling for measures in all three areas. Progress: The initiative ""against mass immigration"" was adopted on February 9, 2014. The pragmatic implementation proposed by the FDP slows down immigration and ensures the continuation of the bilateral path. The bilateral agreements remain the best way to secure and further develop our prosperity in the future. We want neither accession to the European Union nor total isolation. The Foreign Nationals Act and the Naturalization Act must ensure the best possible integration of foreigners in Switzerland. When residence permits are issued for the first time - especially for persons from third countries - integration agreements must be concluded, adhered to and sanctioned if the result is negative. In the area of asylum, the existing laws must be consistently enforced and, in the case of a negative outcome of an asylum procedure, deportation must be carried out consistently. Swiss interests and values have priority: In accordance with international treaties, Switzerland defines the conditions of entry and residence on its territory. Switzerland needs immigrants who are capable of integration and qualified. However, anyone who wants to live in Switzerland must respect our constitution, laws and Swiss customs. Those who do not comply risk having their residence permit revoked. Only under the condition of a tough but fair immigration policy can an opening to the outside world be justified. The FDP takes the concerns of the Swiss people seriously: We take immigration issues seriously. First and foremost, the number of immigrants who do not come to work in Switzerland must be reduced. Education and integration are core values of our society. Respect for public order is the basic building block of good coexistence. Only when integration has been successfully achieved can naturalization be applied for. Our demands EU/EFTA: Secure Bilateral Agreements, Combat Abuses Preservation of the economically important Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons and thus safeguarding the Bilateral Agreements. Rejection of the FMPA termination initiative. Restrict further developments of the free movement of persons to employed persons; no extension of free movement rights under social and residence law to non-employed persons within the meaning of the Union Citizens Directive. For employment contracts of less than one year, admission must be limited to the duration of the employment. Permits should not be renewed or must be revoked as soon as there is a prolonged dependence on social assistance. Third countries: Limiting family reunification and strengthening integration requirements Limit immigration from third countries. Prevent immigration into the social systems by means of consistent enforcement of the law on aliens. When a first-time residence permit is issued, the conclusion of and compliance with integration agreements is the rule. Asylum: Improving enforcement at last Faster asylum procedures and consistent enforcement. Conclude further readmission agreements. Enforce repatriations consistently and in accordance with the law. For the family reunification of provisionally admitted persons, the family relationships that existed at the time of the order for provisional admission are decisive. Revision of the status of provisional admission to the hand. Successes of the FDP.The Liberals Revision of the Foreign Nationals and Integration Act, which specifies the integration criteria, makes family reunification subject to clear conditions, allows the withdrawal or downgrading of residence or settlement permits in the event of negative integration and long-term receipt of social assistance, and makes immigration into the social system more difficult. Implementation of the MEI in conformity with the FMPA, which safeguards the Bilateral Agreements, improves the opportunities of the domestic unemployed on the labor market and thus curbs immigration. Revised citizenship law that establishes tough but fair integration criteria. Clear rejection of the Ecopop initiative. Speed up asylum procedures and stop abuses. Steady political pressure for readmission agreements to allow for the removal of rejected asylum seekers. Exclusion of jobseekers from EU/EFTA countries from social assistance and no extension of permits in case of long-term dependence on social assistance. Securely financing social services FDP.Die Liberalen wants a secure and sustainably financed pension system. A falling birth rate, low interest rates and rising life expectancy are calling the financing of the first two pillars into question. The need for reform is undisputed. Real reforms are needed, or our children will have to plug the pension holes - with cuts in pensions and in key areas such as education, security and infrastructure. The FDP strongly opposes such a betrayal of future generations. External challenges Demographic development (declining birth rate, increasing life expectancy). Baby boom generation enters retirement age. Low interest rates on the capital markets. Disability insurance still owes 10 billion. Freedom, public spirit and progress Freedom: The FDP wants a modern pension system that moves with the times and gives the individual the greatest possible freedom. This means that the economy must also take responsibility and introduce flexible working models that enable a gradual reduction in working hours in old age so that people can leave the world of work independently. Working longer should be worthwhile and partial pensions should allow for a gradual retirement. Public spirit: The FDP wants to bring the intergenerational contract into balance. Unilateral reforms have no chance because they are either pure revenue raisers or raise the retirement age to unrealistic levels. The FDP wants everyone to do their part to stabilize the social welfare system. The unjust and anti-systemic redistribution from working people to pensioners in the 2nd pillar must stop. The reorganization of the disability insurance must finally be completed so that the IV can still pay pensions to those who really need the IV in the future. Progress: Progress, particularly in the healthcare system, has given us one of the highest life expectancies in the world. However, the societal benefit of higher life expectancy also obliges people to perform a service for society in their ""active old age"". This includes not only service to the community in a militia capacity, but also a prolonged contribution to the financing of retirement. Misguided incentives for early retirement in the AHV and BVG are to be eliminated instead of being expanded. At the same time, a debt brake for the AHV should prevent undesirable developments in the budget from leading to mountains of debt. We are one country: We have to give the younger generations the security that the social security system will still exist when they themselves retire. Older workers today must be able to count on being able to use their great know-how: Employers should commit to Switzerland as a business location, use flexible work models to ensure that older workers have their place in the labor market, increase the labor force participation rate in Switzerland and strengthen the competitiveness of the economy, which will at the same time weaken migration pressure. Switzerland is a model of success: Our social services are a locational advantage. In other countries, social welfare systems are heavily in debt: Pensions are cut and the weakest are punished. Switzerland must not make the same mistakes. The FDP believes in Switzerland: Our social services should benefit those who have made a real contribution to their financing. Social tourism is to be combated decisively. Equally important is a modern and efficient education system that enables every child in Switzerland to advance socially. A well-trained workforce is the best guarantee for progress and innovation. Progress means jobs - and financed social services. Our demands Secure social security systems - balanced, generation-appropriate reform A secure, financed retirement provision for young and old. Adherence to the constitutional objective. An intergenerational reform. Those who have paid in for decades should be able to rely on the social security system keeping its promises. Costs must not be unilaterally transferred to the young. Moderated mix of measures of retirement age and additional revenue. Strengthening personal responsibility in pension provision: higher tax allowances in the 3rd pillar and the possibility of subsequent payments. Spending-side reform of IV with a focus on labor market integration: work must be more rewarding than a pension. No continuation of thetemporary VAT increase for IV reorganization. Putting the First and Second Pillars on Safe Ground Equalization of the retirement age for women and men. The savings flow into the AHV. Moderate increase in VAT. VAT has the advantage of being paid by everyone, whether active or retired. From an intergenerational perspective, therefore, it represents the most equitable revenue. The retirement age should be linked either to the financial situation of the pension system (in the form of a debt brake) or to life expectancy. An AHV debt brake as a safety valve. Depoliticize the technical parameters in the BVG (minimum conversion rate and minimum interest rate). Adjustment of the system of wage contributions: Alignment of rates, extension of the obligation to contribute to young workers (including those under 25) and low incomes (lower entry threshold). Modern pension system, flexible working models A flexible retirement age, instead of a rigid age guillotine. More flexible working models and pension systems enable an individual and smooth transition to retirement age. Incentives encourage voluntarily staying longer in the workforce. More active, specialized and personalized support for unemployed older workers by the regional employment service should enable rapid reintegration into the labor market. Successes of the FDP.The Liberals SP attack on the funded system in the 2nd pillar averted: the introduction of a partial pay-as-you-go system in the BVG was prevented (12.4211). 4th and 5th IV revision with the principle ""work before pension"". The parliamentary treatments of the next step - the further development of the IV - are underway. Separation of IV and AHV funds and thus protection of AHV pensions from IV deficits. Rejection of the 1: 12 initiative, which would have further strained AHV financing. Rejection of the ""Altersvorsorge 2020"" reform, which provided for an expansion of AHV benefits and a weakening of the 2nd pillar. The Federal Council has incorporated the main features of the FDP's Plan B for a reform of the 1st pillar. Introduction of a wealth threshold restricting access to supplementary benefits (100,000.- for single persons and 200,000.- for married couples)."
43520,200710,"1. for a family-friendly Switzerland When children become a risk of poverty, our society has a problem. Those who give birth to children lose up to 40 percent of their purchasing power with the first child and 60 percent with the second. This effect is felt not only by lower income earners, but also by the middle class. Families are disadvantaged instead of supported by our tax system. Childcare remains poorly organized compared to other states. More and more new taxes and fees put a considerable strain on family budgets: health insurance premiums, school fees for music, free subject or sports programs, income-dependent daycare premiums or rising waste disposal fees are just a few examples. Our country has no strategy to sustainably reduce these burdens. We do: 1 Our goal is a tax system that consistently takes into account the economic performance of families: Those who raise children and accept a reduction in purchasing power must benefit from significantly lower taxation. Tax fairness must be achieved through a better horizontal equalization of benefits and burdens. 2. 2. food and goods for daily use must not be artificially made more expensive by the upcoming VAT revision. We will ensure that this revision is not made on the backs of families. 3. The compatibility of work and family is a major problem for many mothers and fathers. Children of pre-school age have the right to care, including out-of-home care. All four-year-olds should have access to kindergarten or elementary school by 2009 at the latest. For children and adolescents of school age, there should be a demand-oriented offer of day schools until the end of compulsory education. 4. The protection and promotion of young people are not uniformly regulated in Switzerland today. Many individual provisions are spread over x laws. We demand a youth promotion and youth protection law. 5. Elderly people, families with children and young people are concerned about their own safety: on break areas, in the city centers, in the neighborhoods or on public transport. Police officers are working overtime across the country. There is a shortage of several thousand members in the cantonal corps. We take these concerns seriously. We want better surveillance of sensitive areas through more visible police presence. To this end, the cantons need more resources for internal security. 6. In order to curb youth violence and to improve the integration of all children and young people, we want to introduce compulsory human rights and fundamental rights education in schools throughout Switzerland. It stands on the basis of our Federal Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. 7. parents and educators must be trained to assume their responsibility, parent education is necessary. They should also have access to counseling and guidance and be able to benefit specifically from preventive measures. Parents of all origins must be involved in the school and social co-responsibility. The language acquisition of children of foreign origin and their parents must be promoted. Foreign students who are not familiar with our language must learn the language and familiarize themselves with our values before being integrated into the regular class. The educational and integration opportunities of children of foreign origin shrink massively if we do not insist on the compulsory nature of the curricula: Class camps, gymnastics and swimming lessons are obligatory for all. Thousands of foreign mothers are poorly integrated or not integrated at all in our country . We want to change this situation. We better integrate this target group into the children's everyday school life, promote their language acquisition and improve their participation in social life. The Equality Office must also focus its efforts more on the integration of foreign mothers and women. 2. for a Switzerland with full employment Creating jobs is the goal of our economic policy. More and new companies never have to leave Switzerland. We keep Switzerland at the top of the world: Open export markets, flexible labor laws, innovative strength, an internationally attractive tax climate, first-class infrastructures and a first-class level of education are the success factors. Our plan for work and employment: 1. Our prices are far above the European average. We ensure lower prices for consumers by allowing products from the EU to be sold in Switzerland as well. We protect ecological concerns with special regulations and ensure that domestic producers can also export to the EU without barriers. 2. 2 Open market access is the be-all and end-all for our economy. That is why we are safeguarding the successes of the bilateral path for the future. We say YES to the continuation of the free movement of persons with the EU after 2009. We are prepared to extend the free movement of persons to Romania and Bulgaria with the appropriate transitional periods. Brussels is interfering more and more in cantonal tax sovereignty and wants to restrict it. We have no sympathy for this: we want to maintain healthy tax competition among the cantons and preserve Switzerland's tax sovereignty. 4. if the first experience of young people in the labor market is to receive basketfuls of rejections and to be permanently unemployed, we are creating a social problem of the first order. Good companies train apprentices and are committed to training. The public sector must set a good example and get involved by offering apprenticeships. 5. Business ethics must be practiced. Wage policy is a matter for the social partners and the shareholders. We demand transparency, corporate governance and reject exorbitant severance payments and ""golden parachutes"" for the upper management of companies. But we also prevent the relocation of corporate headquarters and the loss of jobs by opposing state-fixed maximum wages. 6. We are in global competition as a location for companies and their jobs. We want to attract new companies to Switzerland and are aligning ourselves with the best countries in terms of corporate taxation. We are removing hurdles to business succession and abolishing double taxation. We support the revision of corporate taxation. 7. Our economy pays CHF 7 billion for administrative burdens. We will ensure massive simplification in dealings with the authorities: we will introduce a uniform business register (for social insurance, value-added tax, the commercial register, etc.), ensure electronic signatures and halve the administrative burden on companies - especially SMEs. 8. nobody understands VAT practice and the law itself any more. The execution is a single nuisance. We want a quick revision: We create more legal certainty for companies and reduce the jungle of ordinances to a manageable level. 9. Those who make work more expensive create unemployment. We ensure low non-wage labor costs: where social security contributions are not financed exclusively by wage percentages, we do not increase them. There must be no new wage percentages for disability insurance! The digital future has long since begun. Data highways are the highways of the future. We keep pace with this development and invest in communication and information technologies. We rely on e-government and the pacemaker function of the state. 3. for a socially secure Switzerland The economic world demands more and more performance from the people in our country, more mobility, permanent education and training, a willingness to reform and to adapt to rapidly changing conditions. The people in our country are ready to make this commitment. In return, however, we must also offer them security: Our social system is not a ""hammock"" for us, but also not a ""sieve of holes. It radiates the warmth and security needed to cope with the risks and challenges of the new world of work. Our plan for social security: 1. The constant increase in health insurance premiums is a nuisance. Only more competition can slow down the cost spiral: We want to introduce free choice of hospital beyond cantonal borders, alternative cost-reducing insurance models and the electronic health card by 2010. 2. 2. we secure the retirement age of 65 for men and women. We create the possibility for particularly low incomes and in particularly hard industries to retire earlier. Reduced working hours and part-time work must also be made more attractive for older people. We remove all obstacles, also in the BVG, and disadvantages for those who voluntarily want to work longer. 3. 3) We demand new part-time work models for managers, for men, for older employees, for those re-entering the workforce, which do not unduly disadvantage them in terms of pension benefits. 4. we abolish the disadvantages of older employees on the labor market: Employers' contributions to occupational pension plans are currently too high for older workers: we want a linear and equal contribution rate for employers - regardless of the age of the employees. Investments in education and training must become more attractive. We demand that professional training and further education costs of taxpayers can be deducted from their taxable income after completing their initial training, up to a maximum amount to be defined. 6. We support the revision of the disability insurance. Reintegration must be at the center; pensions may only be authorized and granted by independent physicians. We want to reduce the debts and deficits of the IV with a temporary increase in value-added tax. Goods for daily use are excluded. 4. for an ecologically sustainable Switzerland Global warming is a fact. It also poses an economic threat to our country: if the meadows in snow-rich ski resorts remain green, tourism could lose billions. As more and more devastating storms ravage our cities and towns, we will soon see a surge in insurance premiums. The example of the catalytic converter shows: We cannot get by in environmental protection with incentive taxes alone. It also needs prohibitions. Environmental protection offers economic opportunities: We invest in new technologies that will find global demand. Our plan for better air and a more ecological Switzerland: 1. Billions flow out of our country every year to the oil-producing countries. We are reducing our dependence on foreign countries for non-renewable fossil fuels. We provide relief for CO2 emissions, anchor the CO2 levy for the future and continue the Kyoto targets beyond 2012. 2. Energy efficiency must be given top priority in new buildings and total renovations. We want to make the Minergie and Minergie P standards mandatory by 2012. 3. If our household appliances were completely switched off when not in use and not in stand-by mode, we could save a massive amount of energy. Technical regulations are needed here. In the medium term, the approval of appliances that do not belong to the low-consumption energy class A should be dispensed with altogether. 4. Vehicle technology has developed considerably in recent years. We therefore stand for an increase in import duties for ""gas guzzlers"" and demand a particle filter obligation for all newly imported diesel vehicles. With appropriate transitional periods, the approval of diesel vehicles without particulate filters should be completely waived, analogous to the introduction of the catalytic converter. We improve the air quality and reduce the CO2 emissions. 5. we prohibit the alpine transit on the road of trucks that belong to the particularly environmentally harmful categories EURO 0 and EURO 1. 6. demand a supplementary agreement on land transport with the EU, which allows higher charges for heavy goods transit traffic if it does not meet Swiss environmental standards. We close the passage for transit heavy traffic without soot particle filters with an appropriate transition period. 7. we secure the supply of energy to our country. We will prevent an electricity shortfall by implementing energy-saving measures, promoting alternative energies (biomass, geothermal energy, solar heat), expanding hydropower and considering nuclear power as an option. 8 We will increase the share of electricity production from renewable energies to 10 percent by 2020. 9. we reduce the planning, approval and construction phase of a nuclear power plant to 12 years: if the population agrees to the replacement of older plants, implementation must be made possible within this period. We ensure a favorable public service - especially in public transport: companies must organize themselves more efficiently, strive for productivity gains and pass on the cost advantages gained to consumers. We want the price supervisor to conduct a comprehensive analysis of prices in public transport and the SBB. If the GA becomes too expensive, highway kilometers will rise again. In our country, building is still far too often done on greenfield sites and land is used wastefully as a resource. The cantons must coordinate better in spatial planning."
43520,201110,"Help us achieve these goals in the 2011-2015 legislative session with your vote. Your vote in favor of the CVP carries weight, because we keep our promises. A successful Switzerland - thanks to the CVP. Switzerland is a successful and attractive country - thanks to a policy that has long been characterized by responsibility, balance and respect. We, the CVP, have always represented these Swiss values. Switzerland's problems - increasing youth violence, high healthcare costs or migration - are the problems of a successful country. While other parties are badmouthing our country, we are moving Switzerland forward with our Federal Councillor Doris Leuthard! The CVP stands for a solution-oriented policy, for a social and ecological market economy. A livable environment for families, an attractive business location for secure jobs, stable social services and a sustainable environmental policy; constantly optimizing these is our mission - we care about Switzerland! We keep our election promises! We have achieved a lot in the 2007-2011 legislature: More money for families Thanks to the efforts of the CVP, families today pay less tax and are entitled to allowances for each child. Specifically, today CHF 250 per child per year and childcare costs up to a maximum of CHF 10000 per year can be deducted from the tax amount. Fight against high prices The Cassis de Dijon principle has been in force since July 1, 2010. Unnecessary repackaging of imported goods for the Swiss market is eliminated and the prices of many products on the shelves of our supermarkets fall. We were also able to prevail in Parliament with our solution for parallel imports. Parallel imports of patent-protected goods from the EU area are now permitted. This relieves the burden on the wallets of our families and companies. Free market access for our export industry Thanks to the CVP, the bilateral path with the EU has been consistently pursued. Right from the start, we successfully campaigned for the extension of the free movement of persons with the EU Our Federal Councillor Doris Leuthard was able to conclude a free trade agreement with Japan for Switzerland - the first European country ever to do so. Swiss exporters save customs duties and now have direct market access - this preserves and creates jobs! And negotiations on a similar agreement have already begun with China. Repositioning of the Swiss financial center The CVP has taken strong action against shameful bonus payments and golden parachutes as well as for better cooperation in tax cases - because we want a clean financial center! With our counter-proposal to the rip-off initiative, we propose solutions that are effective and economically viable. Jobs secured through rapid assistance in the crisis The CVP has shaped all three economic stimulus programs and helped them achieve a breakthrough. This enabled us to help very quickly during the crisis where help was needed: For young people starting out in their careers, for older workers and in the export industry, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. This has strengthened Switzerland as a business location without leaving the next generation with a huge mountain of debt. Social security secured A high-quality healthcare system at a reasonable price - with this goal in mind, we have pushed ahead with effective measures to relieve the burden on the middle classes, played a major role in the revision of care financing, as well as the system of integrated care, which helps to reduce costs through greater networking of doctors, hospitals and other service providers. We have restructured the disability and unemployment insurance systems, but at the same time prevented this from happening at the expense of employees. Environmentally friendly Switzerland The CVP is the only bourgeois federal council party that is consistently committed to the environment. It is thanks to us that there is now more funding for renewable energy, for building renovations and for promoting the production of clean electricity in Switzerland. We have strengthened hydropower as an important and sustainable source of energy thanks to an increase in the water rate. The CVP also followed up its words with deeds in the areas of river restoration, the expansion of public transport, railroads and urban transport. These examples are exemplary for countless other results. Important decisions will be made in the next four years. How they are felled is up to you. Do not throw away your vote for parties that merely name the problems, promise a lot, but do not work out solutions. Choose a party with a real track record. For our families The family is and remains the foundation of our society. Parents bear a great responsibility, but they should be free to choose how their children grow up and are educated. Family and career must be compatible. We further want families to be able to take care of the older generation. To achieve this, families in all phases of life need three things above all: time, money and infrastructures. The possibility of time off would take a great burden off the shoulders of many. We therefore call for a right to parental leave for fathers and mothers, i.e. a statutory right to unpaid leave and a right to time relief for caring family members. This not only strengthens families, but also reduces care costs. We achieve further strengthening of the family by abolishing discrimination against married couples in the area of taxes and social insurance. In order to secure family incomes, we are calling for new part-time work models for older employees, for people who dare to return to work, but also for professionals in management positions. Expenditure on food, housing, health and education must not be allowed to rise any further, and we will pay particular attention to this in the forthcoming reform of value-added tax. To ensure that the purchasing power of families is not weakened, we are fighting against the flat tax rate. Child allowances should be tax-free in the future, and for relatives of care patients who take care of their needy family members, we demand a care allowance of CHF 50 per day. In all life situations, families also depend on sustainable infrastructures. We therefore call for the introduction of childcare vouchers for freely selectable infrastructures and a demand-oriented offer of day schools. We also call for the creation of daycare places for the elderly, so that family caregivers can be relieved. A secure and successful Switzerland - also in the future! Only in this way can the family remain what it is: the most important pillar of our society. Swiss Team 2011 For the safety of our jobs As the party of working people - employers and employees alike - the CVP is the Swiss economic party. The strong industry, the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), but also the financial center create attractive jobs and thus security in everyday working life. However, globalization and the economic crisis are presenting us with new challenges, as competitive pressure has increased in many areas. We therefore call for measures to ensure that Switzerland remains at the forefront of international competition. Innovation and research are of central importance for the Swiss economy. Those who invest in these areas are to receive targeted tax relief. We demand a high-quality education system, attractive access to the world's most important markets and a reliable infrastructure. We support the creation of new, future-oriented jobs by promoting cleantech projects. The CVP is tackling the strengthening of the dual education system. It is thanks to our labor market-oriented vocational training that Switzerland has very low youth unemployment. Apprentices and professionals need more prospects, students more financial security. We therefore call for minimum standards in the scholarship system and the expansion of regulated permeability between the education systems, especially for those who want to re-enter the professional world after a period of sabbatical. Education must be worthwhile again, and doubly so, because knowledge is the most important resource in our country. Therefore, we demand the exemption of all research expenditures of companies from taxes as well as tax relief for employed persons and re-entrants for training and further education up to CHF 10000 per year. In order to increase the efficiency of Switzerland as a business location, we continue to call for a drastic reduction in the administrative burden and simplification in dealings with authorities. 30% of the daily paperwork between SMEs and public authorities is unnecessary and should therefore be abolished. A successful Swiss economy needs a healthy domestic market, but also access to foreign markets. It was only thanks to the CVP that the bilateral route with the EU came about. We are sticking to this proven path, but are securing further market%access through treaties with other countries and within the framework of the WTO and the OECD. Joining the EU is not up for discussion for the CVP. We are fighting to ensure that the taxpayer never again has to pay for a poorly run large company. We put a stop to the shameful bonus excesses of individual business players. The CVP can and will fully solve these problems in the future. Switzerland has a well-developed network of infrastructures - from rail to road to services. To keep it that way, we defend the public service. We oppose the privatization of SBB and Swiss Post and fight the hasty opening of the postal market. We want the federal government to remain the main shareholder in Swisscom and are fighting to ensure that Switzerland gets the high-performance data highways it urgently needs as a location for research, innovation and education. Our agriculture remains an important pillar of the Swiss economy, and food sovereignty will also become increasingly important in the future. Therefore, we demand that the degree of self-sufficiency remains at least 60% in the future. The CVP stands by direct payments for agriculture. For our social security Our social security system has grown over a long period of time and is efficient and stable. To ensure that it stays that way, the CVP is making sure that this system does not get into financial difficulties. We therefore call for precise coordination of the social security systems, close cooperation between the cantons and a general adaptation of the social security systems to the needs of today's society, in particular a flexibilization of the retirement age both upwards and downwards. Our most important social insurance is the AHV. We want to successfully conclude the next AHV revision in the coming legislative period so that you can rely on the AHV in the long term. We are fighting for retirement age 65 for men and women, creating the possibility of early retirement for physically demanding professions, and generally striving for more flexible solutions. We pay particular attention to the 2nd pillar of our pension scheme. We are fighting to ensure that older workers are no longer disadvantaged in the labor market and are calling for a linear and uniform contribution rate for all. To this end, we call for greater transparency in the administrative and investment costs of all pension funds. We are stopping the explosion of costs in the healthcare sector. Quality at the best price is the goal. Compulsory, solidarity-based health insurance is still the best financing model for this. Through greater transparency, more efficient controls, better coordination among providers and a cap on spending, we are increasing healthy competition again. In order to relieve the burden on families, we are fighting for the waiver of health insurance premiums for children. We want to anchor integrated care in law and create five health regions that make sense in terms of care. We are also expanding the range of palliative care services so that greater account can be taken of the dignity and well-being of seriously ill patients. For our internal security Our country is safe and stable. To cover Switzerland's current military needs, a future army strength of around 80,000 well-trained personnel with modern equipment will suffice. However, this requires a clearer definition of the mission. The CVP remains committed to the militia army, but the militia system must be adapted to today's realities and respect the cost framework of around CHF 4 billion. francs must be respected. In addition to compulsory military service, we call for general compulsory service that is geared to the needs of the armed forces and society. There are individual regions and neighborhoods where their residents no longer feel safe at all times of the day. We do not tolerate juvenile delinquency, brawls at sporting events and violence in everyday life. We demand more resources for police work in the cantons. Specifically, we want an additional 3,000 police officers and 300 border guards, but also a strengthening of cooperation between cantonal police forces and the Border Guard Corps. A tightening of criminal law is unavoidable, so that action against rioters, for example, can be taken more quickly and efficiently. That is why the CVP wants to abolish the conditional fine and reintroduce the short prison sentence. Our youngest children need special protection. We call for a blacklist for pedophile offenders so that they are not allowed to engage in professional or volunteer activities where they might be in contact with children. We also need to be more vigilant on the Internet. Dangerous content is a reality, so our children and young people need more competence in the safe use of new media. We pay the utmost attention to combating child pornography and commercial cybercrimes. We therefore call for an increase in CYCO's staff and the possibility of undercover investigations on the Internet. Safety is also a question of living together. We treat people who come to Switzerland with respect and decency. We grant protection to persecuted people. We demand that mi-grants be given real opportunities for integration, but require them to make a greater commitment to their integration. Our laws apply to all and should be enforced on all. Foreigners who do not abide by our laws are obviously not willing to integrate and should be expelled from the country if they exceed a certain level of punishment. For our environment Our ambitious stance on the environment, for example on CO2 reduction targets, has already paid off. But there is still a lot to do, because we want to leave the next generation a livable and attractive environment and landscape. This requires a global, long-term strategy. In principle, Switzerland can supply itself with energy - that must be the goal of our supply strategy until 2060. We demand the development of renewable energy sources. We want to save more energy, whether in construction, power transmission or transportation. Where technical solutions are available, for example for reducing transmission losses in the power grid, they should be implemented quickly. We call for a turnaround in land-use planning and settlement policies with the goal of shortening work commutes and preserving the countryside and recreational spaces. Agglomerations are to be densified and the rampant urban sprawl stopped. Security of supply is to be ensured by domestic electricity production. Therefore, nuclear power plants cannot be dispensed with for the time being. Existing nuclear power plants are to be replaced by safer and more efficient (possibly smaller) plants if it is no longer possible to extend existing nuclear power plants for safety reasons. Provided that other CO 2 -free energies for electricity production are available in sufficient quantities by the end of the next generation NPP, the phase-out of nuclear energy is to be realized. At the same time, we are obliging the operators of nuclear power plants to make a strong commitment to the development of renewable energy sources (biomass, geothermal energy, solar heat) and to increasing energy efficiency. We are also promoting research and development in this area through more federal funding. We fight for the expansion of hydropower and demand an overall strategy from the federal government on the future energy supply. The aim is to make Switzerland's energy supply independent of fossil fuels. Reducing the consumption of fossil fuels and - associated with this - CO2 emissions remains an important concern. A CO2 emission limit of 100 g/km is to apply to all imported new cars from 2020. To this end, we want to reduce gasoline consumption by 50% over the next 20 years. For example, by 2030, every third car in Switzerland is expected to meet Class A emission levels or be electrically powered."
43520,201510,"Switzerland - our family! Election Program 2015 of the CVP Switzerland In the interest of our SMEs - in the interest of our Switzerland! Switzerland is a successful and attractive country! We have almost full employment, a high quality of life and an exemplary democracy thanks to policies characterized by responsibility, balance and respect. The CVP represents precisely these Swiss values. With us, the people rule. We are proud of our Switzerland! Small and medium-sized enterprises are at the heart of our policy. It is the foundation of our society. Even in a successful country, there are problems that directly affect the middle class - such as high healthcare costs, strong immigration, strained infrastructures or everyday crime. The middle class also has to bear enormous burdens. He does not benefit from government services, but must finance them to a large extent. Here we must maintain moderation so that the foundation of our society remains strong. Switzerland's success is due to its cohesion. The CVP is the party that holds this country together. Instead of acting as demolition masters like the pol parties, we build bridges between left and right; between liberal and conservative; between growth fanatics and environmental fundies. The CVP is committed to preserving the Swiss model of our parents and grandparents, to its reliability! We stand for a federal Switzerland with strong regional structures. We move Switzerland forward; with our policies, our members, our leaders and our Federal Councillor Doris Leuthard! The CVP is responsible for sustainable and solution-oriented policies. We stand for a social market economy. We strive for a fair balance between personal responsibility and solidarity. It needs both! We develop values and shape coexistence on the basis of an ethical-Christian image of man and society. This also includes intergenerational justice. We must not leave a mountain of debt to our children and our children's children. We are committed to a strong middle class, to strong families. Children and young people are the future and the well-being of our country. That is why the CVP pursues an active and attractive middle class and family policy. For us, families and the middle class are at the center! We strengthen the middle class and families through: good framework conditions for families and senior citizens,  stable social services, a high standard of safety in everyday life, secure jobs, strong SMEs, an attractive business location, a high-performance education system, a healthy and intact environment, a future-oriented energy policy and a constructive migration policy. We make ourselves strong for Switzerland, we make ourselves strong for our children! In parliament, the CVP is very successful. It wins 80 percent of all votes. No other party gets its way in parliament more often. It is also thanks to the CVP that Switzerland is in such a good position. This will benefit families and small and medium-sized businesses in particular. We have achieved this in the last four years: More money and time for family and children The CVP has submitted two popular initiatives to ease the burden on families. First, we call for the tax exemption of child and education allowances. Secondly, we want to finally abolish the marriage penalty: Married and registered couples should not pay more in taxes and should not receive less AHV in old age. Today, all these people are discriminated against because of their marital status - this must finally stop! Thanks to the CVP, the people can finally have their say on this issue. Thanks to the CVP, children will be exempt from health insurance premiums in the future. Young adults should pay a reduced premium. Two laws initiated by the CVP are in the works that will not only allow family caregivers time off or relief, but also award them a care allowance. For an efficient education Education, especially that of skilled workers, is a central concern of the CVP. For example, thanks to the CVP, bills are currently being drafted to combat the acute shortage of specialists in mathematics, information technology, natural sciences and technology (MINT). Tax relief for job-oriented education and further training is another project initiated by the CVP: in future, further training costs of up to CHF 12,000 can be deducted from taxes. Thanks to the CVP, companies that are actively involved in vocational training and train apprentices will now be given preference when federal contracts are awarded. For secure social services Thanks to the CVP, the solidarity percentage in unemployment insurance will also be demanded from the rich: In the future, a contribution of one percent will also be levied on earnings above 315,000 francs for the benefit of unemployment insurance. In this way, we accelerate the deleveraging of unemployment insurance, which leads to a relief of the middle class. For more safety Punishments should again be felt as punishments. The CVP has therefore advocated a tightening of the sanctions law. In addition, judges must be able to consider old sentences when sentencing offenders. To this end, the deletion of old convictions from the criminal register will be lifted - thanks to the CVP. For secure borders Thanks to the CVP, the border guard corps can be increased in personnel. This will help to better combat cross-border crime, criminal tourism and smuggling. For strong SMEs Where Switzerland is written on it, Switzerland should also be in it: Thanks to the commitment of the CVP, the value of the ""Swiss brand"" will be secured and preserved in the long term with the so-called Swissness bill. The concerns of SMEs are taken into account. Our national brand should be protected - but without bureaucratic monster exercises. For better infrastructures The Swiss rail infrastructure is unique. To ensure that this remains the case, the CVP, together with its Federal Councillor Doris Leuthard, has strongly advocated the creation of the Rail Infrastructure Fund. This secures the financing of the operation, maintenance and expansion of the rail infrastructure in the long term. Our railroads contribute to Switzerland's high attractiveness as a business location - we take care of it. For an environmentally friendly Switzerland The CVP played a key role in helping the gradual phase-out of nuclear energy achieve a breakthrough in parliament. We are committed to the Energy Strategy 2050, thanks to which less electricity will be used, the consumption of fossil fuels will be reduced and even more reliance will be placed on renewable energies. We want to guarantee Switzerland's energy supply in the long term through domestic and renewable production. For a functioning asylum system The revision of the asylum law was decisively influenced by the CVP in parliament. The new asylum law will lead to shorter procedures, greater security and a reduction in the burden on the cantons. Switzerland becomes less attractive for economic refugees and can thus concentrate on the protection of genuine refugees. In this way, Switzerland is living up to its humanitarian tradition. For a well thought out civil rights law Thanks to the CVP, there is an improved citizenship law. It ensures that only well-integrated persons are naturalized in Switzerland. Naturalization must represent the completion of successful integration. For our families - our children to the center! The CVP's family policy is geared to the challenges facing families today. We promote the quality of life of families in their diverse lifestyles, also in a sustainable perspective - we lay the foundations for a successful future for our descendants. Instead of playing family models off against each other, the CVP places the well-being of children at the center of its political work. We fight for financial relief and economic security for families. Thanks to our initiative to abolish the marriage penalty, we are putting an end to discrimination against married and registered couples and achieving tax equality with cohabiting couples. Child and education allowances relieve the burden on families and must not lead to an unjustified increase in taxable income. Thanks to the popular initiative of the CVP, the allowances can be exempted from taxes. Health insurance premiums are very burdensome for middle-class families with children because they often barely qualify for premium reductions. The exemption from premiums for children and the halving of premiums for young adults will effectively reduce the burden on middle-class families. The CVP is committed to improving the compatibility of work and family life. We are committed to freedom of choice between gainful employment and/or raising children. There needs to be a demand-driven supply of childcare options. In principle, we promote private initiatives, but we also stand for appropriate government support. Accordingly, we welcome the creation of voluntary preschool care services and the development of day structures. These must be oriented to the needs and be structured to complement the school. Children need a strong mother and father presence for optimal early childhood development. The CVP calls for a two-week paid paternity leave for newly minted fathers analogous to maternity leave. We are implementing an SME-friendly tax policy. The middle class must not be burdened even more by taxes and fees. For many services (e.g. crèches, music schools), the lowest incomes are subsidized today, while the burden is limited for the highest - only the middle class pays in full. Work must be worthwhile. Parents who earn two incomes and finance the care of their children themselves must not be penalized fiscally. Conversely, parents who forgo a second income in order to perform as many care tasks as possible themselves should not suffer any disadvantages. We stand behind income-based child care rates. These must be designed to be continuous rather than incremental. Otherwise, there is a risk that the increase in workload will not be financially worthwhile due to childcare rates. We preserve the foundations of life for our children and our children's children. Protecting the environment means preserving all that our future generations need to live: fertile soils, beneficial landscapes, clean drinking water, clean air, an intact climate, and biodiversity. A good education is the best insurance against unemployment. That is why we are committed to an efficient education system and stand by public schools. The CVP supports the HarmoS Concordat in the area of foreign language teaching: in elementary school, a second national language and a foreign language are to be taught in addition to the language of instruction. Housing costs place a heavy burden on families. These costs must not be allowed to rise any further. We create incentives for family home ownership and promote affordable housing. For our jobs and for our SMEs! The CVP is committed to the social market economy. Economic development must be at the service of all and not at the expense of the weak or the environment. In a fair, open and flexible labor market, young entrepreneurs, people re-entering the workforce, disadvantaged and older employees get their chance - we fight for it! Social is what creates work: A strong export economy and an attractive location in Switzerland secure jobs and prosperity. Swiss SMEs are the most important pillars of our economy. We rely on our SME trump card! We fight against wrong or too strict regulations, which threaten the competitiveness of Switzerland and thus jobs. We stand for an open Switzerland. The CVP wants to stick to the bilateral path with the EU, because this is essential for the Swiss economy! We also call for the conclusion of bilateral agreements (e.g. free trade agreements) with additional states. These facilitate SMEs' access to new markets. Joining the EU is not up for discussion for us. The agreement on the free movement of persons is at the heart of the bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the EU. Following the adoption of the mass immigration initiative, the CVP is fighting for a solution that is in line with the will of the people, but at the same time does not lead to the termination of the bilateral agreements. We are reducing bureaucracy in all areas: in social security, customs formalities, the commercial register, building regulations, company formations, apprenticeships, agriculture, all kinds of permits, standards or regulations. E-government should be promoted in order to simplify and accelerate approval procedures. We advocate for a business-friendly tax and fee system. When it comes to major legislative revisions, SMEs must not be equated with large corporations. The CVP demands that SMEs be given special consideration and exempted from unnecessary additional burdens. We expect the Corporate Tax Reform III to bring clear improvements for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as legal certainty and a solution acceptable to internationally active companies so that they have a future in Switzerland. Companies that invest in innovation and research are to receive tax relief. Young companies, so-called startups, are to be given special attention - they are our future! Its innovative strength plays an important role in the development of future business areas. We take the burden off them when they start up and give them tax breaks during the first few years. The attractiveness for Swiss and international investment companies to participate in the financing of Swiss start-ups must be increased. The two pillars of our dual education system must not be played off against each other. The CVP demands that the attractive vocational training system not be further academicized and that this system be better anchored and recognized internationally. In order to preserve the attractiveness of vocational education and training, the CVP demands that graduates in higher vocational education and training should not be financially worse off than students on the university education path with regard to training costs and examination fees. The shortage of skilled workers in various fields has serious consequences for the economy and society. In order for Switzerland to obtain more skilled personnel on its own, the CVP is calling for a nationwide education offensive and the special promotion of domestic workers in sectors where there is a shortage of qualified personnel. We call on employers to consciously recruit on the domestic market and to invest themselves in the training of the necessary skilled personnel. For all the necessity of the free movement of persons, there needs to be a strong commitment to the domestic workforce. The potential of women, including those returning to work, and of older workers is to be fully exploited. We make ourselves strong for you! We demand the fight against wage dumping and bogus self-employment. Foreign companies and employees must also abide by the rules of Swiss competition. The CVP therefore supports effective sanctions as part of the accompanying measures. They protect Swiss employees from wage pressure and create a level playing field for domestic industry. The CVP is committed to a strong public service in the areas of energy, water, transport, postal services, telecommunications, radio and television. For the CVP, the federal government must remain the majority shareholder in federally owned companies that guarantee a basic service. We are committed to ensuring that all regions of Switzerland have secure economic prospects. Special peculiarities and needs of rural and mountain regions must be taken into account in order to prevent migration. The decentralized supply of jobs in the federal administration and federal enterprises must be increased. A reliable transport infrastructure is crucial for the Swiss economy. Both road and rail transport play an important role in this. Road and rail are complementary and should both be expanded moderately and in line with demand. Economic growth must be in harmony with the environment. Resources, such as soil, water or food, require responsible management. We promote climate- and resource-friendly technologies, especially in the field of renewable energies and energy efficiency. We are committed to minimizing our dependence on foreign countries. We demand optimal framework conditions for the companies involved in the energy transition. The energy transition is creating a new SME sector. In particular, we include innovative craftsmen and commercial enterprises that are helping to shape the efficiency improvement of plants, energy-efficient construction and refurbishment, the decentralized development of sustainable energy production and the development of smart transmission grids. The SVP wants to seal us off - the SP wants to join the EU. We want to save the bilaterals! For social security... For the CVP, social security means that the livelihood is protected in old age, in the event of illness or a stroke of fate. Switzerland does have a close-meshed network of social insurance schemes. However, they are confronted with major challenges: People are getting older and drawing pensions for longer. Only lower returns can be achieved on the capital markets than in previous years. Health insurance premiums increase every year and represent a major financial burden for many people. Policymakers must respond to this: People in our country need certainty that they will be cared for in old age and in the event of illness. Thanks to the CVP's popular initiative to abolish the marriage penalty, we are putting an end to the unequal treatment of married couples and registered couples with regard to AHV retirement pensions. Demographic change (increasing life expectancy, declining birth rates) will become one of the greatest challenges for Switzerland in the coming decades. The CVP calls for a cross-departmental strategy to counter this development. The social systems must be secured for the long term; we must train enough skilled workers; rural regions must not be depopulated; and health care structures must be geared to the new challenges. To ensure that we have secure retirement provision in the future, the course must be set now. The CVP wants to save the AHV from financial disaster and guarantee fair pensions in the future. The inflow of funds to the AHV must be maintained. Legislative changes such as tax reforms must not take money away from the AHV. We are sticking to the tried-and-tested three-pillar system. As part of the revision of the pension system, we are working to ensure that the various pillars remain coordinated. The aim is to ensure the financial security of all three pillars. Deficient social insurances are fatal for the trust in our welfare state. That is why the CVP wants to introduce a stabilization mechanism for the AHV that will ensure that expenditures and revenues are in balance in the long term. We support a retirement age model that meets the needs of the 21st century: We promote a more flexible retirement age, provided it can be financed. With the uniform retirement age of 65 as the pivotal point, each person should be able to decide for themselves, within a range of between 60 and 70 years, from when they would like to draw an old-age pension that is correct for them. Those who voluntarily work longer than until 65 will be rewarded. Today, older employees are worse off in the labor market due to the rising contribution rates in the 2nd pillar. To this end, we are calling for newly graduated contribution rates. Healthcare in Switzerland must be sustainable, of high quality and affordable at the same time! We strengthen personal responsibility and solidarity. Due to thresholds in taxes and support contributions (scholarships, childcare contributions, individual premium reductions, disability pensions, etc.), disadvantages arise for the middle class. Such threshold effects should be eliminated by making the assessment of taxes and support contributions, where possible, continuous rather than incremental. We are committed to providing a good quality of life for our seniors. In the future, the number of people in need of care will rise sharply. People who take care of their relatives in need of care make it possible to relieve the burden on Spitex services and help to at least delay entry into a home. In this way, they save the general public from additional costs in the health and social sectors. Voluntary care and support for those in need of care should be recognized and encouraged by offering optimal framework conditions. We are committed to efficient palliative care that enables long-suffering people to enjoy a high quality of life in the final phase of their lives. Healing and alleviating suffering are ethically high goals of medicine. Where healing is no longer possible, dying with dignity must be at the center of medical treatment. ... and for safety in everyday life! We want our citizens to feel safe. Security is an elementary basic human need. Safety means quality of life. We don't want to have to be afraid of break-ins or assaults. We do not tolerate violence in everyday life! Our youngest children need special protection. In order to protect children online, the federal government and the cantons must work together to combat all forms of pedocrime and cyber-grooming (contacting minors on the Internet with the aim of making sexual contact). We are fighting these crimes with all our might. Covert preventive investigation must be possible. Punishments must be felt again as punishments. Criminal law must have a preventive and deterrent effect. Violent offenders should have to answer to a judge. Suspected arrestees should be able to be detained for up to 72 hours. Cooperation between the various security agencies across cantonal borders must be intensified. Federalism must not stand in the way of this. The execution of sentences and measures must also be made more efficient. Combating threats such as terrorism, violent extremism, criminal tourism, organized crime or cybercrime requires sufficient resources for security forces. Thanks to international cooperation, valuable time can be gained in the fight against crime, because crime is international! That is why we are strengthening the Schengen/Dublin system of cross-border security cooperation and implementing it consistently. We want to use access to European databases for the benefit of internal security. Maintaining security and order in public spaces is primarily the responsibility of the state. To ensure everyday security, we demand more resources in the form of personnel and modern equipment for the police and the Border Guard Corps. Specifically, we want another 3000 police officers and 300 border guards. Switzerland must take international computer and cyber risks seriously, because our digital networks are our most vulnerable point. For highly developed Switzerland, attacks on IT infrastructure are a current threat. It is the joint task of the Confederation and the cantons to implement the national strategy to protect Switzerland against cyber risks. Protecting these modern channels of communication and commerce is a core task for security forces in the 21st century. For a constructive migration policy! Openness is one of Switzerland's strengths. In order to ensure that it remains so, the CVP is pursuing four main thrusts: immigration according to economic needs, + a consistent fight against abuse, Efforts to improve the integration of people with a migration background and an efficient but fair asylum system. Migration and integration Our laws apply to all and should be enforced on all. Foreigners who do not abide by our laws are obviously not willing to integrate and should be expelled from the country. Constitutional and international law principles must be taken into account. We are fighting poverty migration. A residence permit must be linked to a valid employment contract. However, the CVP sees the need for local aid and calls for measures to curb poverty migration in the countries of origin. We also call for more difficult access to the Swiss social system for people from abroad. Welfare abuse must be punished more severely. In the area of immigration, we want to consistently implement the will of the people in accordance with the referendum of February 9, 2014 on the mass immigration initiative, while at the same time preserving the bilateral agreements. These are essential for the Swiss economy. We want immigration management to be guided by the needs of the labor market. In view of demographic change alone, Switzerland is dependent on immigration. We respond flexibly to immigration to Switzerland, taking into account the needs of the Swiss economy. We support the accompanying measures implemented by the social partners. Consistent enforcement and appropriate controls of the accompanying measures are needed, especially in the border cantons, so that wage dumping, bogus self-employment and undeclared work do not stand a chance. Integration applies to everyone, from international cadre workers to recognized refugees. We support the facilitated naturalization of young foreigners who have gone to school here, speak our language and are well integrated. We reject an automatic naturalization system. Equal starting conditions are the key to integrating children with an immigrant background. Early integration into a supportive environment, early language acquisition and early social integration in after-school and daycare centers improve the starting chances of foreign children enormously. We recognize the special situation of border regions. On the one hand, cross-border commuters put Swiss wages under pressure, and on the other hand, certain sectors of the economy would no longer be able to function without cross-border commuters. The border cantons are different, not everywhere there are the same problems. The cantons must be able to decide for themselves how much they want to restrict the admission of cross-border commuters. However, they must not be abandoned under any circumstances if there is a threat of being overwhelmed. Asylum Policy We preserve Switzerland's humanitarian tradition and consistently fight the abuse of the right of asylum. Pending asylum applications must be reduced. To this end, we are shortening appeal periods without violating the principles of the rule of law. By centralizing procedures in federal centers, we speed up the processing of asylum applications. Genuine refugees have to be granted asylum as soon as possible. Asylum seekers without recognized grounds for asylum should quickly receive a final decision and leave Switzerland. We consistently combat abuse: anyone who commits a criminal offense during the procedure will not be granted asylum. Anyone staying illegally in Switzerland after their asylum application has been rejected will be taken into deportation custody. Temporary admission must not lead to permanent residence in Switzerland. We call for a perio- dical and consistent review of the status of affected individuals. We do not give ""Sans Papiers"" a legal right to stay and fight undeclared work in this context. We condemn employers who illegally employ ""Sans Papiers"". Naturalization is the completion of a successful integration!"
43520,201910,"THIS IS HOW WE KEEP SWITZERLAND TOGETHER HEALTH POLICY WE WANT A SWITZERLAND WHERE HEALTH IS ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE FOR ALL We have one of the best healthcare systems in the world. Competent professionals do their best to help every day under difficult circumstances. But our health care system is on the verge of financial collapse. For more than 20 years, health care costs and premiums have been rising unabated. If our wages develop as they have in the past, few people will be able to afford their health in the future. But no one has an interest in saving. Neither doctors, the pharmaceutical industry, hospitals nor cantons. Left and right-wing parties are shirking their responsibilities and are unwilling to agree on concrete and known solutions. The cost of this is paid by the population with ever higher premiums. We must finally get a grip on the continuing rise in healthcare costs. This is the only way to avoid multi-class medicine. As a centrist party, we are committed to ensuring that all Swiss residents can count on one of the best and most modern healthcare systems in the world. In a solidarity-based insurance system, however, it must not be the case that it is primarily the middle class that bears the costs. It is time to stop this development. We want the Swiss population to have a say in how much our healthcare system should cost. THE CVP DEMANDS: The CVP demands that every person, regardless of income, age or health risk, can count on good and affordable medical care. That is why a cost brake is needed in the healthcare system. We want to prevent health care costs from rising faster than wages and the overall economy. The Swiss should have a say in how much healthcare should cost. The CVP demands that the well-being of patients, and not economic considerations and profit, be paramount. Expensive and unhealthy overtreatment and overtherapy should be avoided. The outdated and excessively high tariffs from which the system now profits at the expense of patients must finally be adjusted. Overpriced medicines must be reduced. The CVP calls for more transparency and coordination in healthcare. The opportunities offered by digitization must be actively exploited. Patients should be able to assume more personal responsibility. Invoices should become easier to check, and doctors should educate their patients about prevention. Outpatient interventions should be encouraged while reducing hospital capacity. If hospital beds are not used, they must be dismantled. THANKS TO THE CVP: families will be relieved of the burden of health insurance premiums: The CVP has successfully fought for the halving of children's premiums for families with low and medium incomes. premiums for 19- to 25-year-olds will be reduced by up to CHF 100 per month from 2019. the tax deductibility of compulsory health insurance premiums will be expanded: at the cantonal level with a comprehensive tax deduction and at the federal level with a doubling of the insurance deduction for direct federal tax. with the admission control, the cantons will receive a permanent and effective instrument to prevent overprovision in the healthcare system and thus to curb cost growth. SOCIAL WORKS WE WANT A SWITZERLAND THAT IS SOLIDARY AND FAIR Switzerland is facing a serious acid test. Our social security systems are in debt and many people are already worried about their pensions. The working population bears the growing burden of a rapidly aging society. Power games between left and right have prevented urgently needed reforms for 20 years, especially in old-age and survivors' insurance (AHV). We call on all parties to finally find solutions together. We must prevent the population from bearing the massive costs of political inaction. We strive for a society in which everyone has a secure livelihood, those in need receive financial support and social abuse is actively combated. We are the party of the middle. Individual responsibility and solidarity are our compass, guiding us to ensure the sustainable financing of our social services. THE CVP DEMANDS: The CVP demands secure and fair old-age pensions today and tomorrow. The gradual adjustment of the retirement age to 65 is necessary. However, women should not bear the costs for this. Gaps in contributions resulting from maternity, for example, must be compensated. Women and people with low incomes must be better off. People should decide for themselves when they want to retire. Therefore, the retirement age must be flexible between 62 and 70. Work must be financially rewarded and worthwhile beyond retirement age. Pensions must not be allowed to decline. The second pillar also needs to be reformed. This is the only way we can know what we have in our wallets at the end of the month. Job loss is associated with many fears for those over 50. We demand that wage contributions to the 2nd pillar of older employees be reduced and that companies make greater use of the skills of experienced professionals. Contributions to the 2nd pillar should be paid in from the age of 20 rather than 25. The accumulated pension assets can thus be increased, which in turn enables higher pensions in old age. The CVP demands that people live in dignity and not bear the costs of abuse. We demand more fairness in IV pensions and fight against social abuse. Abuse must not pay. Supplementary benefits (EL) guarantee a life in dignity. At the same time, supplementary benefits are intended exclusively for those who really need them. We demand stricter criteria for the receipt of supplementary benefits. The CVP calls for the reconciliation of work, family and recognition of the care of relatives. People who care for their relatives privately and voluntarily make an enormous contribution to relieving the burden on our social welfare systems. However, their work is not sufficiently recognized today. Family caregivers must finally receive better financial support. THANKS TO THE CVP: every franc lost as a result of the corporate tax reform is to flow into the AHV in the future. This solidarity contribution directly benefits everyone. the disability insurance (IV) is financially more stable. social abuse is no longer worthwhile. the important work of caring relatives is on the political agenda. SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY WE WANT A SWITZERLAND THAT GROWS AND IS JUST We have reached a point where many think first of themselves and not of our country. The political left wants to saddle us with anti-business measures. The right sacrifices social cohesion for efficiency and short-term profits. We are withstanding this polarizing pressure. The CVP is the strong political center that defends Switzerland's achievements. We know that our prosperity must be based on economic growth and solidarity. Then, today and tomorrow. Only an economic policy that is growth-friendly and based on solidarity creates prosperity. We want an economic policy that gives companies the leeway they need and calls to order all those who disregard their responsibility to society and the environment. We want prosperity that is fair. FOR A BETTER WORK-LIFE BALANCE Each family must be able to organize itself as it sees fit. But it is becoming increasingly difficult for parents to reconcile family and career. Especially after the first birth, many parents are faced with the unfair choice between work and family. The cost of third party care for children is so high today that often there is no real choice. Those who work should also be rewarded and not punished. Equal pay for men and women is still not a matter of course. Families must be able to rely on affordable and available child care. Often, returning to work after maternity leave is a hurdle. Part-time jobs and flexible working hours would facilitate this, but are not popular as working models, especially among SMEs. However, flexibility is needed in the workplace, also to minimize the shortage of skilled workers. THE CVP DEMANDS: The CVP calls for an end to discrimination against married and registered couples. In Switzerland, 1.4 million people are discriminated against on the basis of their marital status. Married and registered couples still pay more taxes and receive lower AHV pensions than cohabiting couples. This must come to an end. The CVP calls for the introduction of a paid two-week paternity leave. The father plays an equally important role in the child's development and must have the opportunity to fulfill it. While maternity leave is regulated by law, paternity leave still is not. This must change. The CVP calls for reliable and affordable childcare. The education of our children is a fundamental interest of Switzerland. We call for more low-cost family childcare places. Families should be able to deduct effective childcare costs of up to CHF 25,000 from direct federal tax. This is more than twice as much as today. The general tax deduction in the direct federal tax for children and young people in education is to be increased to 10,000 francs. The CVP calls for equal pay and the promotion of flexible working models. Equal pay for men and women with the same qualifications and experience should be a matter of course. Needs for more flexibility in the workplace must be taken into account. Job sharing, part-time work and home office must be encouraged. The federal government and the cantons should fulfill their exemplary function and set a good example. THANKS TO THE CVP: the discrimination of registered and married couples with regard to taxes and AHV is being vehemently fought. a constructive and majority-capable proposal is on the table that wants to anchor the paid two-week paternity leave in law. new crèche places are being financially supported by the federal government. families are being relieved of tax burdens through higher deductibility of effective third-party care costs. FOR GOOD CONDITIONS FOR OUR SMES ALSO IN THE FUTURE SMEs not only make up 99% of Swiss companies. They finance our social services, train our young people and are Switzerland's most important employer. They take on responsibility and bear it with a serene naturalness. At the same time, they are most affected by the growing shortage of skilled workers. Numerous regulations are increasingly hampering our SMEs. We need to remove unnecessary hurdles so that they can continue to play their important role in the future. It needs a finely balanced legal framework that leaves enough room for initiatives and innovation. THE CVP DEMANDS: The CVP calls for adapted rules of the game for Swiss SMEs. In public tenders, not only the lowest price should be considered, but also the best quality and the location Switzerland. SMEs should be able to focus on their core competence: Doing business. They need a legal framework that works for them. They shouldn't have to worry about losing their investments because of short-sighted policies. The rules of the game may well be different for SMEs than for large corporations. Positive approaches such as the different capital requirements for small and large banks in financial policy should also be possible for other industries. The CVP calls for the fight against undeclared work and wage dumping. Companies that pay unfair wages or hire under illegal conditions and thereby gain a competitive advantage must be severely punished. The CVP demands an education that has a future. Vocational training must be promoted. We need to invest in specialized but field-tested know-how. In a rapidly changing world of work and in view of the shortage of skilled workers, training and continuing education are important. Financial incentives are needed for SMEs to offer this option to their employees. THANKS TO THE CVP: popular but short-sighted and harmful initiatives such as the left-wing 1:12 utopia or attempts to seal off the country from the right have been successfully fought. the interests of SMEs are represented in the municipalities, cantons and in Bern. Swiss and foreign SMEs have equal footing when it comes to complying with labor and social standards through a more efficient fight against undeclared work and wage dumping. FOR A STRONG SWISS FINANCIAL CENTER The irresponsible actions of financial jugglers led to the global financial crisis that began in 2008 and also hit Switzerland like an earthquake. The result was an unprecedented threat to Switzerland as a business location and to the savings of the Swiss people. But we are not guided by resentment. Our financial center is an important source of our prosperity and should remain an international leader in the future. It is recognized worldwide for its excellence and stability and is a major employer in Switzerland. Our tradition in banking is to be carried into the future with innovative strength. International regulations have increased in recent years, leaving Switzerland little room to shape its own fiscal policy. The strengths of the Swiss financial center must be defended so that they remain internationally recognized. In this way, we also secure access to foreign markets. THE CVP DEMANDS: The CVP demands that customer protection is guaranteed. We demand that all financial service providers inform their customers transparently, so that the customer knows exactly what he is buying. The CVP demands that the financial center assume its responsibility. We demand that all funds be taxed correctly. The white money strategy must be implemented consistently. We demand that the Too Big To Fail (TBTF) instruments be adhered to. In this way, the Swiss financial center secures the trust of its clients - both here and worldwide. With a good range of sustainable investment opportunities, the Swiss financial center and its clients can make an important contribution to greater climate and environmental protection. The CVP demands international market access for the Swiss financial center. As an important export industry, the Swiss financial sector must once again have better access to foreign markets. The Federal Council must ensure that stock exchange equivalence with the EU applies indefinitely. The adaptation of our legislation to international regulations must not lead to stricter rules in our country than abroad. The CVP demands that innovations in the fintech sector are possible. Financial instruments such as sandboxes or the simplified banking license, which grant new and innovative service providers certain freedoms, must not be abused. Innovation must not come at the expense of customer protection. THANKS TO THE CVP: customer protection in the financial sector was significantly improved. The savings of clients in the event of bankruptcy are now protected up to CHF 100,000 instead of CHF 30,000. our financial system is more resistant to crises thanks to the implementation of the TBTF rules. Switzerland has chosen a pragmatic path, thanks to which our financial center can remain innovative and competitive and international market access can be secured. FOR A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF DIGITALIZATION Modern technologies have fundamentally changed our habits in a very short time and are so present in our everyday lives that we no longer even notice. The Swiss economy and population are benefiting from this change. Amazon, Uber, Airbnb have created jobs, simplified the search for housing, brought about low-cost alternatives. But all of this comes at a price. These new business models are challenging our world as we know it. Digitization means that jobs we still take for granted today will no longer be known in an increasingly automated working world in 30 years' time. Switzerland has the necessary tools to meet the challenges of the future. But only if we know how to combine innovation with social security. We must not blindly integrate innovations into our economy and everyday life, but with respect for our society and with caution. THE CVP DEMANDS: The CVP calls for the potential of digitalization to be exploited. We want to create conditions for companies to test innovations without losing sight of the risks. We call for a responsible expansion of e-government for the benefit of private individuals and companies. The recognition of digital signatures at all levels of government or digitally viewable filing systems could simplify our everyday lives. The CVP calls for Airbnb and Co. to be held more accountable. International digital service providers must unconditionally respect Swiss standards. If they disregard our laws, they must be held consistently accountable. It is unacceptable for employees to be treated unfairly, Market power exploited or laws are circumvented. THANKS TO THE CVP: Are companies like Booking. com and Airbnb are increasingly being held accountable. Is the expansion of coordinated and responsible e-government between the municipalities, cantons and the federal government being driven forward. FOREIGN POLICY WE WANT A SWITZERLAND THAT IS NETWORKED AND SOVEREIGN We live in turbulent times. A world order that has brought us peace and prosperity since World War 2 is in danger of collapsing. Powerful states pursue pure interest politics and increasingly isolate themselves. In Switzerland, too, left-wing and right-wing Federal Council parties are uncompromisingly pushing their agendas and shirking their responsibility to jointly address the most pressing problems: Our relationship with the European Union, migration flows or even climate change. Switzerland has achieved a very high level of prosperity thanks to its open attitude, diverse society, reliability and sovereignty. We want this to continue in the future. We want a Switzerland that is neutral and sovereign, but does not isolate itself. It must remain a reliable partner and stand up for its interests with backbone. A successful Switzerland needs a strong center policy, a strong CVP. Now more than ever. THE CVP DEMANDS: The CVP calls for a self-confident EU policy. No other partner has contributed so much to our prosperity. And the EU also benefits greatly from us. We want a deepening of the relationship with the EU that is neither to the detriment of Switzerland nor of the EU. For the CVP, one thing is clear: The bilateral treaties are not negotiable. The people have said yes to this several times. Moving freely in Europe, selling our goods and services without disadvantages in the EU, the exchange of knowledge - we all benefit from this every day. We will not jeopardize the bilateral path with the EU and are committed to an institutional framework agreement that is capable of gaining majority support. In its current form, the agreement is not sufficient and should therefore be adapted in the following points, among others: No threat to our social security system. Citizenship of the Union does not belong in the Treaty. No softening of wage protections. We need a solution for the accompanying measures. The Swiss population's right to have its say at an early stage must be strengthened so that it is not ignored in the dynamic adoption of law in the future. The CVP calls for close economic relations with our partners. Free trade agreements (FTAs) are the right means to this end. In doing so, we must confidently represent the interests of our own economy to partner states. For the CVP: Switzerland must actively conclude new FTAs so that it does not become dependent on a few partners. Switzerland must defend the very own interests of affected Swiss industries in negotiations. We must not buckle. must not make agreements at the expense of our planet. The CVP demands that Swiss companies not be indiscriminately sold out abroad. Our knowledge and expertise are two of our most valuable resources. If foreign investors and states buy our companies, our knowledge must not be transferred to foreign companies without prior examination. There is a need for a Swiss authority that can initiate measures in the event of critical company takeovers. The CVP calls for Switzerland to remain strongly networked internationally and to gain weight. In a globalized world, Switzerland must not withdraw. We do not want a foreclosure policy. Switzerland is a reliable and neutral partner. Dialog is our strength. This must continue to be the case. If we maintain good relations with our partners, Switzerland can also respond better to new threat situations, crises and emergencies thanks to a broad network. We want to have a say, not simply take over decisions. THANKS TO THE CVP: Switzerland has successfully fought isolationist tendencies and secured the bilateral path with the EU. remains an open foreign economic policy on the Federal Council's radar. This gives Swiss companies good access to foreign markets. solutions are to be developed to ensure that Swiss knowledge and expertise are not recklessly disclosed when companies are taken over by international investors or states. MIGRATION WE WANT A SWITZERLAND THAT IS HUMANE AND DETERMINED The large number of children, women and men who have made their way to Europe in recent years because of poverty and war, but also because of a lack of future prospects, have shown the limits of European solidarity. The countries at the Schengen external borders, such as Italy, Spain or Greece, are under enormous pressure. Switzerland is in the middle of Europe and is also exposed to this pressure. While the left is ready to open the door to everyone without question, the right is striving for the hermetic sealing off of Switzerland. What Switzerland needs is a forward-looking migration policy. It is important to integrate those who come to Switzerland and are allowed to stay here. It is important to uphold our values of living together and to discuss these values with people from other cultural backgrounds as well. Abuse of our social systems, on the other hand, we do not tolerate. THE CVP DEMANDS: The CVP calls for a controlled asylum policy. Switzerland's humanitarian tradition should be preserved. Asylum should only be granted in compliance with our laws. For the CVP, one thing is clear: that persecuted persons in need of protection are granted asylum in Switzerland, but Switzerland should not be an attractive destination country. that thanks to faster asylum procedures we can return people who have no right to asylum in Switzerland to their home countries more quickly. The CVP calls for Swiss development cooperation to focus strategically on those regions from which people migrate to Switzerland. Development cooperation is to be increasingly linked to progress. In this way, we support local people while safeguarding our own interests. For the CVP: the challenges of migration can only be solved with our partners. Europe must be able to better manage migration and combat abuse more efficiently. development cooperation must be more closely linked to migration and economic policy. Larger bilateral support in development cooperation should increasingly be linked to readmission or investment protection agreements. The CVP calls for measures that integrate immigrants in a targeted manner. We Swiss believe in social cohesion, equality before the law, freedom and personal responsibility, but also in solidarity and tolerance. People from other cultures should also respect and expect these values. For the CVP: is to learn a national language quickly. It is the key to successful integration. clear integration agreements should be concluded and also adhered to. THANKS TO THE CVP: the new asylum law provides for shorter procedures, thus creating more security and relieving the cantons. Effectively persecuted and vulnerable persons benefit from this. is the Civil Rights Act more handy. Only well-integrated persons are naturalized. Naturalization is the conclusion of successful integration. criminal foreigners are returned to their countries of origin in compliance with international law. CLIMATE & ENVIRONMENT WE WANT A SWITZERLAND THAT GROWS INNOVATIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY Heavy precipitation leads to flooding and sliding mountain flanks, hot summers and drought make alpine farming difficult and reduce harvests, winters with little snow threaten tourism. We are not just feeling many of the effects of climate change today. Switzerland, as an Alpine country, is strongly affected by this. We are the first to feel the consequences when our environment goes bad. That is why we have always taken care of it. That's why we are the only civic party that is consistently committed to protecting our environment. The young generation is taking to the streets and is not prepared to accept the consequences of their parents' indifferent approach to the environment and to stand by and watch inactive politics. And rightly so. The only thing is that young and old alike must realize that environmental awareness means adjusting one's own behavior. The weekend trip by plane to a nearby foreign country or strawberries at Christmas - for many a matter of course. But there is another way to protect the climate effectively. A sustainable climate policy with brains and a social conscience is acutely endangered. While the political left is throwing around bans and moralizing blame, the right has watered down the CO2 law beyond recognition and is betting that the market will sort everything out. The Energy Strategy 2050 was approved by the people with a large majority. Cantonal referendums, however, now oppose consistent implementation. This threatens to bring the energy transition to a standstill. We must not allow the momentum we have started to falter. We are not willing to sacrifice effective climate policy for ideologies. We are the party of the middle, working out viable solutions. THE CVP DEMANDS: The CVP is calling for a strong CO2 law. We want to achieve most of the ambitious CO2 reduction targets of the Paris Agreement at home. This is how we promote innovation, invest in Switzerland and strengthen our business location. We call for the introduction of an airline ticket levy. Air travel is too cheap today. Air traffic must also make an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Marginal and mountainous regions must be considered when fuel prices are increased. People who live in remote regions cannot easily switch to public transport. The CVP demands that the energy turnaround be implemented consistently. Domestic, renewable energy sources must be able to fill the gap left by the loss of nuclear power. We want a secure power supply for Switzerland. It must be worthwhile to invest in hydro, solar or wind power. Incentives are needed for investment in renewable energy. The CVP calls for the expansion of cleantech. We are committed to the circular economy, regional and seasonal products. If we use our resources efficiently and sustainably, we will create lasting prosperity and high employment in Switzerland. Products should again increasingly be manufactured in such a way that they can be recycled. The manufacture of products that are intentionally short-lived must be curtailed. THANKS TO THE CVP: the environmental article has been in our constitution since 1971. the nuclear phase-out and thus the energy turnaround was initiated. the Energy Strategy 2050 is being implemented with domestic, renewable energies and is effective, business-friendly and also socially responsible. Switzerland has signed the Paris Agreement and has been pursuing an ambitious climate policy since the end of the last century."
43531,200310,"FOR A SWITZERLAND THAT MOVES FORWARD: AN EFFICIENT AND MODERN CIVIC PARTY THAT COMBINES PATRIOTISM, CONSISTENCY AND OPENNESS With six out of 200 parliamentarians in the federal councils, one might think that the Liberal Party of Switzerland (LPS) is a small party. This is not the case! Despite the small number of representatives at the federal level, the LPS is a large party. She demonstrates greatness first and foremost with her ideas and her political line. Liberals represent an all-encompassing body of thought rooted in timeless values. These are rooted in the philosophy of the Enlightenment and defend and affirm principles such as personal freedom, Consideration for other people, the recognition of different identities and differences, Responsibility, creativity and the entrepreneurial spirit as the only proven sources of economic and social progress, the progress of mankind. The party is also great because it is not one-sided and weakly distributed throughout Switzerland. The LPS has strong historical roots in our country. It is the leading, second or third largest party in four cantons: Basel-City, Geneva, Neuchâtel and Vaud. Here, it is well represented not only in the parliaments - this is also the case in Valais - but also in the governments. Considering that the four cantons together are home to 13 out of 27 of the companies represented on the Swiss Market Index (SMI) and that their capitalization represents 75% of the SMI, it is clear that liberals are broadly represented and contribute to the existence and development of Switzerland's economic and financial backbone as a driving force for the country's prosperity cause and itself. Switzerland's liberal party is not afraid to position itself as a bourgeois party, as a party of the efficient and modern right, which promotes patriotism - the liberals are attached to this country and show this with their actions/ - and consistency - they fight the cost explosion and tax excesses - and are committed to openness - they support innovation, creation, research and collaboration. With this conviction, the Liberal Party of Switzerland is approaching the 2003 election year with determination. She is enthusiastically committed to a Switzerland that moves forward. For a Switzerland that is creative. For a Switzerland that frees itself from the burdens of state administration. For a Switzerland that finds new growth, which it had never been allowed to abandon. 10 GOOD REASONS TO VOTE LIBERAL! TARGET LABOR MARKET: GROWTH 3% 1. Switzerland is the only Western European country with economic growth below 1%. In order to be able to create new jobs, the economy must grow more strongly. The same conditions apply to the financing of our social security and health care system. Reducing the tax burden, combating bureaucracy, making education and research more dynamic. Liberals are doing everything they can to ensure that our country achieves a target of 3% growth in the shortest possible time. TARGET TAX+0% TAX 2. To ensure the economic recovery of our country, it is necessary to promote the development of competitive enterprises, support household consumption and motivate the creative and entrepreneurial spirit. Our tax system must be designed in such a way that it strengthens rather than weakens this dynamic. Liberals proposed a general tax amnesty in 2003. They will continue to work tirelessly in the future to ensure that new tax plans are stopped. and tax relief for all citizens, namely for families and businesses, be enforced GOVERNMENT SPENDING TARGET: HEALTHY FINANCES100% 3. government spending has increased immeasurably. The lack of budget discipline, constant federal deficits, funding for outdated structures and unnecessary projects have overburdened operating expenses and are exploding debt. It is imperative to put a stop to the downward slide in public finances. Specifically, this involves increasing spending only in those sectors (e.g., health) where demographics make it essential. In all other sectors, costs and investments must not exceed GDP growth. GOAL FREEDOM: PUBLIC SECURITY 100% 4. Security and freedom are closely linked: without security, there is no freedom. The rules must be respected by all, otherwise the laws shall be applied without delay and effectively. In the face of increasing immorality, crime and feelings of insecurity, we propose in particular the creation of a fast-track procedure for arrests in flagrante delicto, with which certain offenses can be punished immediately. TARGETED EDUCATION & RESEARCH:RESOURCES+10% 5. Switzerland's future depends on the quality of school, vocational and university education and on the dynamism of basic and applied research. Solid knowledge, an inventive spirit, in-depth know-how and, above all, an entrepreneurial will are fundamental conditions for job creation and Switzerland's economic and social development. For this reason, the Liberals are in favor of investing in research and development. and educational programs. TARGET COMPANY: RESPONSIBILITY 100% 6. More than 99% of Swiss companies are SMEs with fewer than 500 employees. They account for nearly three-quarters of the country's jobs. Political responsibility demands the granting of framework conditions that allow them to survive and develop without administrative burdens. This improvement has a logical consequence: the social responsibility of entrepreneurs. Because for liberals, more freedom means more responsibility. TARGET SOCIETY: UNDERDIVISION100% 7. The soundness of a society also depends on its ability to support the poorest. Only a flourishing economy can free up the funds needed for this. The goal of any social assistance policy must be to promote a return to independent and integrated living. Liberals are therefore committed to consolidating our system, which is satisfactory in and of itself, and oppose jeopardizing the system with excessive demands that are harmful to the future. TARGET FAMILY: DEVELOPMENT 100% 8. Liberals are very family oriented. The state does not replace the family, but should support it. The Liberals will propose and support tax measures, especially those that relieve the burden on working parents. Improving early childcare structures and redesigning school schedules can make family life easier, especially in the many cases where both parents are employed. TARGET INSTI-TUTIONS:NEAR100% 9. Liberals support the freedom of world trade, but are subject to local co-determination, of municipal autonomy, federalism, very attached to the regional identity on this continent. As a necessary complement to economic globalization, liberals call for a citizen-oriented institutional framework that allows everyone to live out their cultural, historical and religious identity. This is to prevent us from falling into uniformity and centralization, which would be emasculating and financially costly. GOAL OPENING: ENGAGEMENT100% 10. Switzerland's indispensable economic opening to foreign countries must go hand in hand with a political, cultural and social opening that respects our country's identity and diversity. This is the basis for a prudent engagement that strives for an efficient, profitable and sustainable integration of Switzerland into the international community."
43810,199910,"ELECTION PLATFORM 1999 Foreword On the threshold of the new millennium, Switzerland faces a number of major challenges: Unemployment, globalization and changing values, but also the high national debt of the industrialized countries, increasing tax pressure and the unsolved asylum problem are central issues that the political parties have to deal with today. The SVP sees the challenges as an opportunity for our country to demonstrate its strengths. The SVP's vision for the next millennium is a Switzerland of direct democracy, vibrant federalism and diversity; a Switzerland of a solid middle class and freedom for citizens; a Switzerland in which young and old stand together and all inhabitants can live in independence, security and freedom. The basis for this is an independent and neutral Switzerland with a state that is close to its citizens and focuses on individual responsibility. The SVP assumes its responsibility as the governing party. Its aim is to provide support and create identity, and thus also to act as a political counterweight to globalization. The SVP puts people at the center and builds on fundamental Christian values. Human dignity and morality should determine development and progress. With a sense of responsibility and solidarity on the one hand, individual responsibility and fairness on the other, we can secure the future of all. For the SVP, the following applies: trust in the tried and tested, freedom for the new. The SVP has confidence in Switzerland's strengths, in the power of the middle class and in the performance of young people. The SVP advocates more room for individual responsibility and entrepreneurial spirit, for creative solutions and innovations, for freedom of action for trade and agriculture. The SVP is using the 1999 election year as an opportunity to point the way forward for Switzerland with 19 themes and 99 positions. Work Work - together with the will to perform, personal responsibility, education and openness to the world - is the basis of Switzerland's success story. Only a healthy, competitive economy guarantees jobs. It is the responsibility of the state to create the necessary framework conditions for this. Due to the deterioration of these conditions, unemployment has become a long-term problem for our country. Although the unemployment rate has fallen, it is still over 3%. At the same time, undeclared work is becoming more and more of an issue. The unchanged large hole in the unemployment fund, despite falling unemployment figures, is also devastating. Something has to be done here. The unemployment fund -a bottomless pit Unemployment insurance is intended to provide assistance to genuine unemployed people. However, depending on its design, it may also lead to higher unemployment rates and incur corresponding costs. Too long a reference period makes reintegration more difficult. In contrast, a stated focus on intermediate earnings, as well as graduated stamp benefits, would help put unemployment insurance at the service of maximizing employment. The principle of ""work before stamp duty"" must be clearly in the foreground. In 1995, during the revision of unemployment insurance, the FDP, CVP and SP promised a balanced account by the election year 1999. The warnings of the SVP were thrown to the wind. Today, we are facing an actual financial debacle of unemployment insurance. Increasing the contribution rate will not solve the unemployment fund problem. Instead, the SVP believes that the following measures should be taken: Restrictions on eligibility for dual earners with higher incomes Longer waiting periods Reduction of benefits for persons without support obligations Adjustment of the amount and duration of benefits Effective combating of abuses Expansion of reasonableness Efficient integration of the older unemployed through targeted supplementary benefits The goal must be to reduce wage percentages and to reduce federal and cantonal payments to the unemployment insurance fund to 0. Work before stamp duty Measures to reintegrate the unemployed are insufficient and inefficient. ""Employment"" programs too often live up to their name: Instead of preserving and promoting expertise and thus facilitating reintegration, they merely provide employment. Equally questionable is often the range of continuing education courses offered. The placement of jobs by the regional employment centers (RAV) functions with varying degrees of success. Especially in smaller communities, decentralized solutions are more case-appropriate. The SVP therefore opposes the -general introduction of centralized systems. Assistance adapted to the special situation is needed by the unemployed over 50. In this age group there are at least three times more long-term unemployed than among younger unemployed. Special measures for reintegration are therefore urgently needed here. Temporary wage subsidies are one possible solution. Also increased- tax deductions for companies that hire such job seekers. The payment of stamp duty benefits until the end of the period of unemployment should only be an emergency solution. More flexible working hours for all Work and leisure have changed in recent decades. Aware of this, the SVP called for flexible forms of working time as long as ten years ago. Innovative models in this area must not be hampered with rigid regulations. Individual working hours and vacation models bring benefits for all. Possible forms are: Annual working hours, flexible weekly working hours, flexible long-term leave, and flexible entry into and exit from the workforce. Such models can contribute not only to job creation, but also to solving the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises and seasonal businesses. A general reduction in working hours, on the other hand, would only bring more unemployment by leading to further rationalization and thus to additional job destruction. Jobs instead of idle time Wage instead of stamp duty STANDPOINTS: The SVP is committed to business-friendly policies that create jobs The SVP is calling for a restructuring of AL V and a reduction in salary deductions through Efficient integration of older unemployed people through targeted additional benefits Reduction in benefits for persons without support obligations Restrictions on benefits for dual earners with higher incomes Longer waiting periods Adjustment and gradation of benefits Extension of reasonableness Combating abuses The SVP is in favor of flexible working hours and vacation arrangements The SVP calls for decentralized, case-based job placement The SVP combats undeclared work Asylum and foreigners policy Switzerland ,has by far the highest proportion of foreigners in Europe after Luxembourg and Liechtenstein. The number of foreigners in our country now accounts for over 20% of the population. We are at the limit of material and social integration capacity. In addition to the rising proportion of foreigners, the increasing abuse of asylum is also causing growing resentment among the population. Social peace in the country is at risk. The SVP wants to counteract this development with a consistent asylum and foreigner policy. Fight xenophobia, but do it right Switzerland is too attractive for illegal immigrants and economic migrants due to its high standard of living, its generous social benefits and its elaborate procedural and asylum appeal possibilities. The Federal Council and other parties did not want to admit this for too long. Illegal immigration, asylum abuse and also moonlighting, however, not only make the Swiss population shake their heads, but also offend those foreign fellow citizens who have been living and working in Switzerland for years with respect for the laws and customs. Abuses of the right to hospitality encourage xenophobia, which ultimately affects everyone. The anti-racism criminal norm does not solve this serious problem. It turns out to be a symptom control, and by the imprecise facts even a muzzle! Xenophobia and racism can only be effectively countered by consistently combating abuse and stabilizing the proportion of foreigners. Asylum for real refugees People who are demonstrably threatened with life and limb in their country and therefore seek protection should be granted asylum in Switzerland. However, Switzerland is mostly visited for other reasons. It is considered worldwide as a rich country with unlimited opportunities. Many illegal immigrants therefore try to force a stay in Switzerland by applying for asylum. These obvious abuses must be curbed through efficient border protection and a robust asylum law with short procedures and consistent enforcement. Contrary to the promises of the Federal Council, the mountain of asylum applications is growing. That is why the SVP is launching an initiative against asylum abuse and to reduce Switzerland's attractiveness as a country of asylum. Immigration with moderation Switzerland is not a country of immigration. Nevertheless, the Swiss Plateau is already one of the most densely populated regions in the world. With the current legal basis, only a small part of immigration can be controlled. The current Aliens Act of 1931 therefore urgently needs to be updated. In particular, family reunification must be reorganized: a waiting period of 5-7 years must be introduced for family members and the age limit for children must be lowered from 18 to 14 years. This would be a first step toward reducing the proportion of foreigners in the long term. Integration includes two Integration is a cornerstone of any meaningful policy on foreigners. However, it only works if the number of foreigners does not exceed the capabilities of the host country. Moreover, integration is not the responsibility of the host country alone. It is also the responsibility of the immigrant himself. Integration in the social and cultural sphere hardly depends on state funding. Rather, it is based on the willingness of immigrants to settle in the host country, but also of the local population to accommodate the foreigners. The basis for this is honest information from both sides. Questionable naturalization practice The SVP is in favor of naturalization for integrated foreigners. However, many persons who are naturalized with the current procedures cannot be considered integrated. Naturalization campaigns are sometimes conducted to whitewash statistics. Moreover, sometimes the goal of the applicant is not Swiss citizenship, but the benefits from it. Such practices must be labeled as abuses and must be prevented. For a credible and future-oriented migration policy STANDPOINTS: The SVP launches an initiative - to combat asylum abuse and to reduce the attractiveness of Switzerland for asylum seekers The SVP advocates swift enforcement of asylum decisions The SVP demands effective measures for the effective stabilization of the entire foreign population at the level of the end of 1998 in compliance with mandatory international law in Switzerland, namely a revision of the Foreign Nationals Act the new regulation of family reunification The SVP demands a review of the anti-racism penal norm in the sense of a more precise definition of the offence Education & Research Education is one of Switzerland's most important resources. Professional knowledge and skills essentially determine the performance of our country. A meaningful education system imparts not only knowledge and skills, but also values and virtues. Switzerland's high level of education must be maintained in the future. The limited financial resources must therefore be used as efficiently as possible at all levels. This also includes the willingness to change structures. Where is the quality of elementary school? The quality of education in public schools is declining. Performance incentives have been banished in many cases. The teaching of traditional values and virtues such as reliability, discipline and respect is frowned upon. This also makes the work of teachers more difficult and leads to a lack of motivated teachers who still want to fulfill the original role model function. Only a performance-based school can prepare for a performance-based society. Different talents must therefore be taken into account. A particular problem is the increasing number of foreign students. Foreign children must be prepared for school with language courses, if necessary. They should also be classified primarily by ability and not just by age. Where necessary, special classes are to be set up for foreign pupils who do not speak the national language, so that the teaching of Swiss children does not suffer. An important component of basic education in multilingual Switzerland is the teaching of the national languages. Only in this way can Switzerland's multilingualism continue to be used as an advantage in the future. High-quality instruction in the native language and a national language as the first foreign language are indispensable. Vocational training and university Higher school degrees and, in particular, university studies are becoming increasingly popular. Our universities are bursting at the seams. This inevitably lowers the quality of education. At universities, more and more young people are being educated for long years past the labor market. This trend urgently needs to be countered with measures at various levels: Access to secondary schools must not be made any easier, vocational training must become more attractive, and studies must be streamlined and made more practice-oriented. The tried-and-tested vocational apprenticeship system with training in the company, introductory course and vocational school must be retained. However, vocational training must adapt to the changing requirements of the new professions. Innovations are necessary so that an attractive range of services can also be provided in new occupational fields such as telematics. At the same time, measures should be taken to promote companies that offer apprentices good training opportunities: such companies should be given special consideration in tender procedures. Administrative hurdles to apprentice recruitment should be eliminated whenever possible. Yes to Switzerland as a center of research Switzerland has the highest density of Nobel Prize winners in the world and occupies a leading position in basic research. It is important to continue to maintain Switzerland's place in the world, because research is the key to economic success. This requires not only the preservation but also the expansion of Switzerland as a research location. Primarily, favorable framework conditions for research must be secured. A generous environment must be created for companies to invest in research. Progress should not be hindered by overanxiety, but should be used as an opportunity. Research funded by public money should give sufficient weight to the market and practical relevance. In view of the ailing federal coffers, responsible use of financial resources is called for. Research work in one's own country that can be monitored and coordinated is to be given preference over international projects with unclear responsibility. Closer cooperation between universities and the private sector, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), is also desirable. Appropriate projects are to be promoted. Education and research for the next millennium! STANDPOINTS: The SVP stands for a performance-oriented education system The SVP focuses on the performance of young people The SVP demands more cooperation between universities and the private sector The SVP advocates closer links between practice and research The SVP wants attractive, future-oriented vocational training The SVP demands that children of foreigners be enrolled in school in accordance with their linguistic abilities as far as possible, if necessary in special classes The SVP advocates the promotion of the national languages in primary school lessons Europe Switzerland has close cultural and political ties with all European countries. It occupies an important role in Europe geographically and economically. As a serious and trustworthy trading partner and producer of high quality and exclusive products, it has made a name for itself worldwide. Our country is considered exemplary in many areas (democracy, environmental protection, social security and economic performance). Europe therefore has a great interest in the accession of Switzerland, an important and financially strong trading partner, to the European Union (EU). The SVP does not believe that Switzerland should join the EU. The application for membership submitted in 1992 must be withdrawn. However, the SVP welcomes Switzerland's cooperation with the EU in the form of balanced bilateral agreements. The discussion about EU accession has so far been conducted primarily on an emotional level, with fears of isolation being stoked and euphoria about Europe being spread. Objective weighing shows that the disadvantages clearly outweigh any advantages. Some advantages... Joining the EU would facilitate Switzerland's cooperation with Europe in various areas. Mutual market access and the improved exchange of information open up new opportunities: Advantages would arise in particular for the export industry through the reduction of customs formalities. Provided the EU states agree on a transnational V experienced, the fight against organized crime and asylum abuse would also be facilitated. Also mentioned among the benefits is Switzerland's right to have a say in the EU, as well as the European recognition of Swiss diplomas, which gives Swiss nationals easier access to jobs abroad. Such benefits can also be achieved on the basis of bilateral negotiations. ...many disadvantages Joining the EU would massively restrict the autonomy and independence of our country: On the one hand, a cosmopolitan Switzerland would have to focus too one-sidedly on Europe alone. On the other hand, the right to have a say in EU bodies would be paid for with the loss of part of the people's rights to Brussels. The pressure on Switzerland would increase in several important areas: The EU still has high unemployment and large social disparities. Switzerland would therefore become the milk cow of Europe. Among the resulting disadvantages, the following weigh particularly heavily: higher costs in the social sector, nonsensical transports due to forced imports of agricultural products from the EU area, cheap competition for domestic trade and agriculture. In addition, a massive increase in value-added tax is to be expected for various reasons. Switzerland's financial contribution to the EU alone can only be financed through increased VAT. This also applies to the other additional costs incurred. No to the strategic goal of ""EU accession After weighing up all the pros and cons, the SVP rejects accession to a bureaucratic and centralist EU. The SVP sees good bilateral agreements as a real alternative for optimizing cooperation between Switzerland and European countries. The current bilateral treaties must now be examined. If the bilateral agreements are approved, they must be implemented quickly. Balanced bilateral agreements and an independent foreign and economic policy have been repeatedly hindered by the Federal Council's declared strategic goal of EU accession. Switzerland lacks credibility when it signals during negotiations that it is prepared to go much further than offered. The SVP is therefore calling for a departure from the strategic goal of EU accession in view of future negotiations with the EU on further dossiers. Confident and neutral in the heart of Europe STANDPOINTS: The SVP advocates an open attitude towards all states The SVP advocates the bilateral path of cooperation instead of integration. The SVP is now demanding a thorough examination of the bilateral treaties with the EU and immediate implementation in the event of a positive assessment. The SVP rejects EU accession The SVP calls for the withdrawal of the EU accession application and a departure from the Federal Council's strategic goal of ""EU accession"" in favor of a broad discussion on the possible forms of cooperation Federal Finances The federal treasury is in a disastrous state. Switzerland lives beyond its means. Several austerity packages in recent years have done nothing to change this. There is obviously a lack of will on the part of parliament, the Federal Council and the administration to make energetic savings. This development paralyzes the state. The federal government has debts of over 100 million francs! The state now spends more on debt interest than on education! The debt costs us 3.5 million francs a year in interest, i.e. 10 million francs a day! Each taxpayer is thus burdened with over 1000 francs per year! Rising expenses Since 1991, the federal government has spent more than it has taken in every year. No citizen could afford such a thing. The Federal Council and Parliament, on the other hand, continue to muddle along unconcerned. Not so the SVP: It has already tried to pull the emergency brake four times and has presented detailed savings programs. In vain. The Federal Council and Parliament have each dismissed the programs as a horse cure. But the SVP is not giving up. Only with drastic cuts on the expenditure side can the federal finances be restored to health in the medium term. This misery can no longer be solved by ""paving the way"". The SVP will continue to pursue its consistent austerity policy. The focus is on the areas with the highest growth in expenditure: Asylum system Relations with foreign countries Bureaucracy Traffic When making savings efforts, it is important to ensure that the differences in financial performance between the cantons are reduced as far as possible. The quality of life in rural regions must be maintained with a sufficient financial transfer from the federal government to the regions, especially to improve the necessary infrastructures and to realize the tasks at hand. This also contributes to national cohesion. More new taxes? Instead of saving money, new sources of revenue are constantly being sought at the expense of the middle class. The following new taxes have been decided or are planned: HVF, Alpine transit tax, energy tax, gasoline price increase, C02 tax, solar tax, capital gains tax and stamp duties. Additional wage and VAT percentages seem self-evident, contrary to all promises. Devastating consequences The consequences of this development are clear: pressure on interest rates, declining creditworthiness of our country, less investment; - threatened jobs and thus burdened social works, a ruined middle class. While other countries are lowering their taxes and thus creating attractive framework conditions and new jobs (e.g. England, USA, Holland), Switzerland is going in the opposite direction. Of every franc earned in Switzerland, almost 40 centimes already go to the state. This means we lose our competitiveness and drive companies abroad. At the same time, employees are left with less and less of their wages. Here, countermeasures must finally be taken. Taxpayers should not have to pay the interest of the wrong policy with more and more levies. Economic stimulus through tax cuts is more effective than expensive stimulus programs. Mismanagement of the Federal Pension Fund Federal rice pension fund another hole in federal coffers. Order must be established here before the financial consequences become unbearable. Such conditions would have had far-reaching consequences in the private sector and would have brought the law enforcement authorities onto the scene. At stake are the savings and earnings of thousands of employees and pensioners. In the end, the taxpayer will once again be asked to foot the bill. The SVP is calling for the rapid privatization of the federal pension fund and the equal sharing of costs in the area of the 2nd pillar. The problems of other federal funds also need to be addressed. Saving instead of fleecing! STANDPOINTS: The SVP opposes the exploitation of the middle class The SVP opposes new taxes, wage percentages, levies and fees The SVP wants the federal treasury to be restructured without additional revenue The SVP demands special measures to restructure the federal pension fund The SVP is committed to reducing inequalities between agglomerations and mountain regions Society and family The social and family environment is of fundamental importance for our well-being. The social changes of the last decades, which are still ongoing, threaten the family. New ways of living do not offer equal substitutes for all. The loss of tried-and-tested values that have provided support means that many people can no longer find their way in society. Widespread insecurity leads to general defensiveness and aggressiveness. The consequences are a growing lack of sense of responsibility and a related distrust of the free and democratic state. Yes to the family The family is important especially in a changing society-and should be encouraged. Man and woman are equal and equal partners. They should find a way of life and division of labor appropriate to them, aware of their common responsibility. The state must provide the necessary framework conditions for this. These essentially include tax relief for families, optimization of the child and family allowance system, targeted support for low-income families, and family-friendly models for occupational pension provision (2nd pillar). Responsibility for our children The SVP is committed to the protection of born and unborn life. It therefore also advocates a responsible approach to reproductive technology. Children are more than a cost factor. They convey joy and enrich society. The family thus bears a great responsibility with the upbringing of the children. The state must do its part by providing a favorable and safe environment. For example, in view of changing family and work structures, a suitable social infrastructure is needed to ensure childcare. Consistent school schedules are just as important as flexible non-family care options. Childminders, crèches and day schools must guarantee sufficient care for children where working and living conditions (e.g. in conurbations) make this necessary. The goal is not the transfer of child-rearing to state institutions, but a comprehensive and coordinated care and education system of parents, companies and public institutions. Trust in the young The SVP focuses on young people as the future of our country. In modern society, young people find new opportunities for development and growth. However, these also bring greater difficulties in finding a place. The meaning and purpose of life, society and the state are more often questioned. The growing juvenile delinquency rate is, among other things, a consequence of this overall social development. Ultimately, everyone suffers from this. Society must not be concerned only with the special cases. It must have the best interests of all young people in mind. The problems of young people can be met at school, but also in clubs. Teachers must be trained accordingly and be able to act as role models in terms of their personality structure. The approximately 1 00,000 clubs in Switzerland can contribute a great deal to an attractive range of leisure activities for young people, as well as offering prospects and support. The Young SVP also strives to show young people the way to an interesting and politically active life. Together with seniors Senior citizens are playing an increasingly important role in society. With retirement, the older person only gives up his or her occupation, but not his or her right to have a say as a full member of society. The _society should again increasingly benefit from the great knowledge and experience of the older generation. Today's seniors want to lead active and self-determined lives for as long as possible. Very few of them are dependent on constant help and care. The elderly have a right to a secure, dignified and meaningful existence. Old-age policy must not only be oriented to their needs, but must be shaped together with the older generation. The SVP is particularly committed to recognizing the merits of Swiss men and women during World War II. It demands that a stop be put to the denigration of the World War II generation. No society without family STANDPOINTS: The SVP is calling for better tax treatment for families The SVP stands up for the protection of born and unborn life The SVP is committed to the concerns of young people and supports an attractive range of educational, sporting and cultural activities The SVP supports the appreciation and self-determination of senior citizens The SVP is committed to the participation and co-determination of senior citizens in decision-making bodies that are socially and politically important to them Health policy Being healthy is considered a fundamental right in a modern society. Switzerland is known worldwide for its high standard of healthcare. In terms of public health, developments continue to be mainly positive: Infant mortality is falling and life expectancy is rising. On the other hand, almost nowhere in Europe is the abuse of addictive substances as high as in Switzerland. No liberalization of soft drugs There is no region in our country, no matter how rural, where narcotics are not trafficked. Although the number of heroin and cocaine addicts remains high at around 30,000, abuse of soft drugs has increased. Switzerland is also flooded with new drugs. The SVP opposes any liberalization of soft drugs. Playing down soft drugs sends completely the wrong signals. Addiction is not a lifestyle, but leads to loss of free will and thus loss of agency and human dignity. Heroin delivery under strict control There is a big question mark over heroin delivery. It must always be emphasized that this must not be a first step towards the liberalization of drug use. Heroin distribution is to be continued exclusively under strict control and scientific monitoring. A long-term success control must first show whether the measure is suitable to lead to drug abstinence and a reduction in the number of offenses. Who wants open drug scenes? Open drug scenes attract crime and damage Switzerland's image. It is a scandal when the general population has to avoid parks and public places because a minority of addicts set up shop there. Telephone booths, public toilets, underpasses, even entire train stations are reluctantly used by many today because they feel threatened there. This not only means a reduction in the quality of life of each and every individual, but also harms the business located in the respective places. Repression must therefore be an indispensable part of drug policy in the interests of all. The SVP therefore welcomes police measures. But the drug problem must be addressed at all levels. There must be enough treatment centers available that enable addicts to finally quit addiction. In addition to prevention, repression and therapy, the SVP is also in favor of survival assistance with the clear goal of quitting addiction. Fight against the abuse of stimulants Even stimulants such as tobacco and alcohol harbor dangers of addiction and health risks and require conscious, responsible use. The increasing consumption of alcohol by young people is striking. The designer drinks aimed at a young audience are selling like hot cakes. Cigarette consumption also increased significantly again after a temporary decline. This is despite the fact that the harmful effects on health have long been known and are also declared on the packages. Advertising bans are hardly an effective means of countering these developments. On the other hand, the drastic consequences of the misuse of stimulants must be repeatedly pointed out by means of broad-based information campaigns. In particular, an appeal must be made to personal responsibility. In addition, the age limits for the sale of tobacco and alcohol must be strictly observed. A serious problem today is also the abuse of medications. Everyday life should be able to be managed normally without pill rations and performance-enhancing substances. In a society that turns tablets into food, we should not be surprised at the use of ecstasy by young people. It is the task of politics to create free and humane framework conditions that enable a fulfilled life in leisure and work without medication support. For health care, see under chapter social security No trivialization of drug use STANDPOINTS: The SVP is in favor of therapy offers with the goal of freedom from addiction The SVP fights open drug scenes The SVP opposes the legalization of soft drugs The SVP is in favor of strict control and scientific monitoring of heroin distribution The SVP is in favor of better education about legal and illegal addictive substances Communication and media Today we live in the communication age. The development of worldwide communications networks and the advance of globalization are closely linked. This trend will continue and change both public and private life. Freedom of the media The SVP sees developments in the communications and media sector as an opportunity. The new opportunities should be available to all citizens in high quality. The SVP is therefore committed to a liberal and free media order. However, this is only possible if the media are used responsibly. Media are not a consumer good like any other, but also have cultural and national political significance. Liberalized communications networks The SVP is committed to the liberalization of communications networks. Abuses that may result from previous or new monopoly positions must be consistently eliminated. The public provision of communications and media services in the peripheral regions must be ensured. New media at the service of all The use of so-called ""new media"" such as the Internet opens up new opportunities for the economy, but also for each individual. The misuse of new media with criminal intent must be combated internationally. Excessive government regulation, on the other hand, is inefficient and only hinders positive use. As far as possible, everyone should have access to the new media. This is particularly important in the case of training. Information through radio and television The SVP is committed to the greatest possible diversity in radio and television. SRG and private providers must be able to coexist and fulfill their mandate. The basis for this is a meaningful definition of the public service. All providers should have the opportunity to offer public services. In the future, too, the SRG's function in terms of providing a wide range of information is to be taken into account. However, this should be possible with a minimum of artificial protection measures. The SVP advocates that the restrictions to which private radio and TV stations are currently subject (advertising time, broadcasting area, etc.) be significantly relaxed. In areas where competition exists, providers must be on a level playing field. The SVP therefore demands a rapid revision of the radio and TV legislation. Threatened diversity of the newspaper landscape The diversity of print media (newspapers, magazines) is fundamental for ensuring regional and local information. It alone also ensures the broadest possible opinion formation for all. This diversity is threatened today. A number of newspapers have already been received. The SVP is committed to continuing to try to counteract this trend with targeted promotional measures. Professional journalism The SVP values professionalism and ethics in journalism. This means, above all, careful, responsible and fair reporting and research work. The SVP is therefore committed to good education and training for media professionals in our country. The goal would be a recognized degree. It would also be desirable to establish a code of honor for journalists. The SVP also supports the protection of legal interests that can be violated in the media (e.g. reputation, business and official secrecy) and rejects the misuse of the right to refuse to testify. Diversity and freedom in communication and media STANDPOINTS: The SVP is committed to diversity of opinion in communication and the media The SVP demands that all regions of our country be able to take advantage of the new opportunities in the field of communication The SVP demands a rapid revision of radio and television legislation The SVP demands a redefinition of the public service in the field of electronic media, with the possibility that private providers entitled to reception fees can also provide corresponding services The SVP is committed to the promotion of new media with the least possible legal restrictions Culture and customs As a diverse country with four national languages and 26 cantons and half-cantons with their own traditions, Switzerland has an exceptionally rich cultural life. It is precisely this diversity that is an essential part of our national identity that must be preserved. The traditional cultural exchange across language borders is a model worldwide. Culture for all The cultural spectrum is diverse: it includes not only literature, ballet, opera, theater and museum, but also domestic and foreign customs as well as Expo.0l, Street Parade, film festivals, pop concerts and much more. Culture is alive and can be lived. It conveys identity. Culture must remain diverse and be able to offer something to everyone. Only in this way can it fulfill its purpose, which is to impart joie de vivre, enrich everyday life, provide meaningful employment, and promote communication and understanding across borders of all kinds. Culture is not a luxury In more difficult economic times, it is understandable and necessary to prioritize the basic needs of the population. However, it is still necessary to provide funds for culture so that it can fulfill its many functions. The decisive factor is that it is no longer distributed by the watering-can principle, but that targeted support is provided where it seems sensible and necessary. On the one hand, the interest of broad sections of the population should be in the foreground, and on the other hand, money should not be distributed where success ensures the return anyway. Promoting culture must not be the sole task of the state. Rather, culture needs many sponsors who work together. A functioning partnership between the public and private sectors is therefore indispensable, especially in the cultural field. The approximately 1,00,000 associations are particularly important here. In many cases, it is thanks to them that culture is preserved and promoted. They create structures for the integration of different groups and make their contribution to coexistence in society. They build bridges between generations, but also between different language and population groups. They deserve tax breaks and support. Culture, Switzerland's business card Culture also makes an ""essential contribution to international exchange. Cultural organizations and events help to convey the image of a diverse Switzerland and make a decisive contribution to Switzerland's reputation abroad. This benefits not only the tourist country, but also Switzerland as a business location. EXPO.0l EXPO.0l is an opportunity for Switzerland to celebrate and show its best side. The new millennium was to begin optimistically and full of zest for action. EXPO.0l is meant to be an invitation beyond the country's borders. The concept must be generous to the occasion. This includes the planning and expansion of travel routes as well as the on-time set-up and the necessary international advertising. The Federal Council is called upon here to take the necessary measures to ensure that the event can be carried out successfully. Framework conditions and organization urgently need to be optimized. EXPO.0l should be a positive signal and not a flop of the beginning new millennium. Culture for all and in the interest of all STANDPOINTS: The SVP stands by diverse culture and linguistic diversity as identity characteristics of Switzerland The SVP is committed to culture and customs The SVP is committed to a successful EXPO.0l The SVP calls for targeted cultural promotion instead of the watering can principle The SVP is committed to tax benefits and support for associations Agriculture Agriculture has shaped the image of our country and its population for centuries. Farm families provide us with healthy food, ensure the settlement of remote areas and maintain our cultural landscape. Agriculture is the cornerstone of our identity. The challenges of the future Agriculture is changing. The ongoing structural adjustment cannot be stopped. In the next few years, farmers and all upstream and downstream operations face major challenges. The fulfillment of the GATTIWTO agreement (dismantling of customs duties), the effects of the ""Agricultural Policy 2002"" and the hole in the federal coffers are shaping agricultural policy and affecting structures and jobs. The global development of food prices continues to put pressure on farmers' incomes. Other events are casting their shadows: EU enlargement to the east and the next round of WTO negotiations. The pressure on agriculture will therefore increase. Goals of Swiss agriculture The SVP is committed to an independent, producing agriculture that strives for the highest possible degree of self-sufficiency for the country. With the new Agriculture Law, we are following this path while respecting an ecological, sustainable and comprehensive management of our land. Farmers should primarily produce healthy food while showing consideration for an intact landscape. They should be able to continue to perform the many functions in the interest of the public. In order for agriculture to fulfill its important mission efficiently and in a first-class manner, the SVP relies on the family farm. The family business with well-trained farmers guarantees a healthy cultivation of our land and a professional food production. The SVP therefore places emphasis on the promotion of these clear family structures and modern practical research and training. Farmers as entrepreneurs If Swiss agriculture wants to out1perform, it must also be competitive with other countries. The SVP therefore calls for a comprehensive program to reduce production costs, i.e. above all a reduction in unnecessary requirements and obstructions. Farmers must be able to act as entrepreneurs. In particular, direct marketing must not be hindered. The SVP also demands a clear and honest declaration of domestic and foreign agricultural products. Domestic products must not be disadvantaged. In the service of our country Agricultural policy needs regional anchoring and networking. Farming families and their businesses form the backbone of society and the economy in structurally weak regions. Those who disregard this networking in rural regions will later have to invest a lot of money in regional development projects - as a glance at EU agricultural policy shows. For the SVP, agricultural policy is therefore the key to the prosperous development of the regions. Not all of these services to our country are compensated by the market. The SVP therefore supports targeted direct payments. Ecological production For the SVP, ecology and animal welfare play an important role in agriculture. Appropriate legal foundations are essential, but must neither lead to overregulation nor impair the competitiveness of businesses. Almost annual adjustments of laws and regulations unsettle farmers, bring high costs and insufficient yield. Hobby and after-work businesses do not need government support. Direct payments for ecological services must benefit producing family farms. The SVP also calls for more consideration of practice and reason in agricultural production instead of more and more regulation. Mountain areas and tourism In our country, agriculture in mountainous areas has a special role to play. The maintenance of the landscape and the settlement of rural areas in such areas is an indispensable prerequisite for the prosperous development of tourism. The SVP therefore supports and promotes projects for better cooperation between agriculture and tourism. No Switzerland without agriculture STANDPOINTS: The SVP relies on producing family farms with well-trained farmers The SVP supports agriculture as a central element in the development of rural areas The SVP demands direct payments as remuneration for the farmers' performance in the service of the public The SVP advocates a professional and dynamic agriculture with competitive structures and lower production costs The SVP promotes the production of local specialities The SVP demands a comprehensive declaration of domestic and foreign agricultural products The SVP fights qualitatively questionable imported products Security Safeguarding peace and order is the central basic task of the state. Security is the basis for the development of all economic and cultural life. This is being forgotten more and more today. Contrary to widespread belief, the security threat has not diminished in recent years, only changed. Today, danger rarely comes from entire nations, but all the more from terrorists and blackmail groups. Thanks to new technologies, damage can be inflicted both from inland and from a considerable distance. Internal and external security are becoming less and less clearly separable. Security measures must be geared to this changed threat situation. The state must ensure that the necessary funds are made available. The cooperation of the individual departments must be better coordinated. In the long term, an actual security department should be created. External security There are more trouble spots today than ever before. Threatening arsenals continue to exist and are under opaque ownership. They pose a threat that is difficult to assess. The SVP therefore considers our militia army and its modern equipment to be necessary and important. It will fight the redistribution initiative and any future attempts to abolish the army. Due to technological progress, wars are no longer fought only with traditional armies. Our armed forces must also adapt to the changed threat situation. The first priority must be to optimize the company's own resources. The Army still needs efficient armaments to fulfill its mission. Further financial depletion of the armed forces is no longer justifiable in the national and international interest. International cooperation can do its part to increase security. However, permanent armed neutrality must be maintained. The SVP rejects the idea of joining NATO. Internal security Today, it is primarily internal security, i.e. security in everyday life, that is under threat. The trend toward greater propensity to violence must be described as frightening. It is reflected, among other things, in the 20% increase in assault offenses over the last ten years: the rising number of foreign perpetrators is a cause for concern. At over 51%, the share reached a peak at the end of 1998. The number of foreign perpetrators identified in Switzerland has thus increased by more than 20 percent in the last ten years! Offenses committed by asylum seekers, illegal residents and international gangs are the main focus here and must be combated quickly and in a targeted manner. The activities of activists and civil war parties who support conflicts abroad from Switzerland by raising money and recruiting fighters must also be stopped. The fight against organized crime Organized crime is a problem from which even Switzerland has not been spared for a long time. The organized groups no longer stop at any border. Drug and arms trafficking, prostitution, trafficking in women, racketeering, and smuggling have been supplemented, among other things, by business involving the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Criminal tourists also specialize in burglary tours across the border. Police and law enforcement agencies on the ground are often overwhelmed. Effective control should therefore begin at the border. The defections of criminal gangs and lone perpetrators must be prevented already there, if necessary with the help of the army. Also fundamental is the fight against money laundering, which can strike at the lifeblood of organized crime. Cybercrime The Internet not only offers new search possibilities, but also almost limitless opportunities for criminal activity. These excesses must be vigorously combated in international cooperation. No cost-cutting exercises for the police Many cantonal police corps are understaffed and thus have the greatest difficulty in fulfilling their tasks. They lack not only the human and financial resources, but often also the technological means. More and more people are therefore turning to private security services. Security threatens to become a luxury. There is an urgent need for action here. Cost-cutting measures must not lead to a safety risk. Good technical equipment and increased police presence are efficient means of preventing crime and ultimately pay off for everyone in terms of avoiding follow-up costs. Security is a basic need, not a luxury STANDPOINTS: The SVP stands by the well-trained militia army that is equipped to deal with new dangers The SVP calls for the creation of a security department The SVP supports permanent armed neutrality The SVP calls for efficient border protection The SVP fights all attempts to abolish the army and rejects the redistribution initiative The SVP supports subsidiary operations of the army at home The SVP calls for effective international cooperation in the area of cybercrime The SVP demands the necessary financial and logistical resources to support the army and the police Solidarity The term ""solidarity"" has been strained a lot lately. It is about time that Switzerland remembers the core content again and finds back to a real solidarity. Real solidarity True solidarity begins on a small scale, in the family: the old support the young, the young stand by the old, the stronger helps the weaker. Cohesion and balance between the regions of our country is also an expression of solidarity. Solidarity should not be practiced in foreign policy alone. The SVP advocates that solidarity should also apply to those in need in one's own country. Genuine solidarity cannot be enforced by laws. Forced solidarity only leads to resentment, reduces individual responsibility and increases demands. Solidarity, however, can be fostered by leaving sufficient room for maneuver in a just and predictable state structure. Those who are sure that their work will be allowed to bear fruit will also be in solidarity with those who need help. Good services Switzerland also demonstrates its solidarity with other countries in many ways. Since World War II, solidarity has been one of the guiding principles of Swiss foreign policy. As a neutral and independent state, Switzerland is tailor-made to play a leading role in mediating conflicts. It thus makes an important contribution to European and global cooperation. The SVP remains committed to putting neutrality at the service of the community of nations. Disaster relief Swiss Disaster Relief (SHA) provides much-appreciated on-site assistance around the world. This contribution is a further expression of Switzerland's solidarity with other countries. There is broad support for the work of the Corps. The Swiss population also personally demonstrates time and again with generous donations at collection campaigns that it is a matter of concern to each and every individual to help where there is need. International Committee of the Red Cross With the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Switzerland makes a global humanitarian contribution. The work of the ICRC is based on the principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntariness, unity and universality. In this way, Switzerland not only shows its solidarity, but also places its neutrality at the service of the international community and international humanitarian law. The SVP advocates that Switzerland remains credible as the neutral founder and headquarters of the ICRC. UN accession As a consultative state, Switzerland also enjoys prestige at the UN and its voice is heard. Switzerland is a member of and contributes to various sub- and specialized agencies. In 1997, Switzerland contributed CHF 470 million to the budget of the UN and its specialized agencies. The SVP, on the other hand, rejects UN membership because it is incompatible with neutrality. Development cooperation -Refugee aid The federal government makes a substantial annual contribution to development cooperation and refugee aid. The SVP stands by Switzerland's humanitarian tradition. However, on-site assistance must be a priority. Development funds must be increasingly put at the service of refugee policy. The SVP demands that funds be tied to strict conditions: Countries that do not take back their compatriots after a rejected asylum application should not receive any support. Aid is intended to benefit those states that are striving for a just and democratic system of government. Solidarity Foundation The Federal Council believed it had to demonstrate Swiss solidarity by announcing the endowment from the National Bank's reserves. However, the foundation idea with an unclear purpose sent the wrong signals. The anniversary donation is reinterpreted by foreign countries as an admission of guilt. The result is extortion on behalf of Holocaust victims. A No to the foundation idea is inevitable in terms of foreign policy and will earn Switzerland respect. A yes vote, on the other hand, would inevitably lead to new demands. As an alternative, the SVP calls for the proceeds from the management of the National Bank's surplus gold reserves, i.e. those not needed for monetary policy, to be used for the benefit of the AHV fund. By securing this social welfare system, a future-oriented solidarity contribution could be made for all. The prerequisite for this is a prior structural safeguarding of the AHV. Genuine solidarity cannot be blackmailed STANDPOINTS: The SVP shows solidarity with those in need in its own country The SVP supports cohesion and balance between the regions of our country The SVP stands for a Switzerland that opposes any form of blackmail The SVP calls for personal responsibility instead of an entitlement mentality The SVP stands for a neutral, independent Switzerland of good offices The SVP rejects joining the UN The SVP proposes using the proceeds from the surplus currency reserves for the AHV Social security The social welfare system is a central achievement of modern Switzerland, and the SVP is committed to maintaining and safeguarding it. Due to the economic development, social security could be steadily expanded over the years beyond what was necessary. Today, however, we are on a dangerous path: citizens are being driven more and more into dependency, with the state demanding ever higher taxes, levies and wage percentages in order to redistribute them in the form of social benefits. The cost explosion in social services also raises the question of what services the state can and should provide, and how existing resources can be used most efficiently. The centralized system and high premiums and payroll deductions are leading to more and more abuses. Personal responsibility must be put back at the center of social policy. An expansion of the welfare state is neither necessary nor affordable today. The SVP is opposed to new compulsory insurance schemes and social welfare systems that operate on the principle of redistribution. A sensible overall strategy must be developed for the long-term safeguarding and reorganization of the existing social welfare systems. AHV/IV The AHV/IV is the central social welfare system. Together with supplementary benefits, it should adequately cover the subsistence needs of the elderly and disabled. It is essential to preserve the core functions of this insurance. The demographic development of our population and the economic recession in recent years pose financial problems for the AHV/IV. These must be solved in a sustainable manner and without additional wage percentages, among other things through better management of the fund's assets. The transition from the pay-as-you-go to the funded system should be examined. The SVP is also calling for the proceeds from gold reserves not needed for monetary policy to be used for AHV/IV. In the interest of the future of the AHV/IV, the SVP advocates the same retirement age for men and women, a more flexible retirement age and the adjustment of widows' and widowers' pensions with sufficient social cushioning. In addition, the IV benefits catalog must be reviewed and the motivation to integrate disabled persons into the world of work must be promoted. The primary objective is to meet the additional demand caused by demographic factors. There is no room for expensive new services. The SVP calls on the Federal Council to set out the long-term direction of the social welfare system, also with regard to the bilateral agreements with the EU. Occupational pension and third pillar In addition to the AHV, the second and third pillars are of greater importance today. Only they ensure that the accustomed standard of living is maintained in old age. Their design today is satisfactory and efficient. The second and third pillars must not be touched in their basic orientation. However, more family-friendly systems are to be strived for. Health insurance The SVP advocates a socially and financially sustainable health policy. Health care costs must be stabilized. Premiums need to go down. By international standards, Switzerland now has the most expensive healthcare system in Europe and the second most expensive in the world after the United States. The reasons for the cost explosion in the health care system are manifold: the price increase in health care, especially hospital stays, the blatant oversupply of medical services, higher demands for treatment and comfort, the aging of the population, and the excessive consumption of health care services by insured persons thanks to the expanded coverage of services by health insurance companies. All those involved in the healthcare system are now called upon to do their part to reduce costs. It is not acceptable to try to cover costs through ever higher health insurance premiums. On the contrary, it must finally be possible to reduce premiums to a tolerable level again. The SVP is therefore calling for a reduction in the compulsory benefits catalog, an increase in the deductible rate, a reduction in the oversupply in the hospital sector, but also an improved risk equalization among the health insurance companies. In addition, to ease the burden on families, it should be possible to exempt children from premiums where necessary. Sport The SVP has special ties to sport and provides the Minister of Sport in the form of Federal Councillor Adolf Ogi. It attaches great socio-political importance to both popular and professional sports. The SVP is therefore in favor of diverse sports in schools at all levels, youth and sports (Y+S) as well as mass sports, especially sports for seniors. Sport and society Sport is of fundamental importance to society. It is a school of life and an ideal form of encounter at the same time. Above all, sport is also fun and makes a significant contribution to public health and thus to reducing healthcare costs. For young people, sports offer meaningful leisure activities and opportunities for development. The youth and sports support system must therefore be maintained and expanded. The SVP also supports the National Sports Facilities Concept (NASAK) as a basis for sports promotion. Sport promotes communication and teamwork. Sports clubs in particular have a major responsibility in society. They are meeting places for young and old, enabling contacts across social, cultural and linguistic boundaries. Sport for all should also include the approximately one million elderly people. The promotion of senior sports is an issue that needs to be addressed more intensively. The SVP is committed to ensuring that money from the lottery fund is increasingly used to promote mass sports and, in particular, sports for seniors. Sport and image The staging of major sporting events such as the 2006 Sion-Valais-Wallis-Switzerland Winter Olympics and the World Ski Championships St. Moritz/Pontresina are of central importance. As national events with worldwide appeal, they are the calling card of Switzerland as a business location and tourist destination. This gives our country the opportunity to demonstrate its hospitality, showcase its scenic diversity and promote its products and services. We can and must face such challenges. Without mass sport no top sport - Without top sport no mass sport STANDPOINTS: The SVP supports a wide variety of sports instruction at all levels of schools The SVP supports private sports schools and public schools that ideally combine professional sports training and school instruction The SVP supports more funds from the lottery fund for mass and senior sports The SVP supports major sports events such as the World Ski Championships St. Moritz/Pontresina 2003 and Sion 2006 Sport and economy Sport is an important economic factor. 16 billion Swiss francs, i.e. around four percent of the gross national product, are generated in this sector in Switzerland every year. This corresponds roughly to the size of the agricultural sector. The economic significance must also be taken into account in the organization at the federal level. It must be possible to concentrate and coordinate the public-law tasks in sport. The SVP is therefore in favor of combining the competencies within the various departments and offices in one place. With a Federal Office for Sport, the framework conditions for top-level sport can also be improved. Because without top-class sport there is no mass sport. Young talent must be better supported by ideally coordinating school and sports. SVP politicians repeatedly advocate private sports schools and public schools that combine professional sports education and schooling. To support top-level sport, the army must also look for better solutions. During the service period, athletes should be able to train optimally. State The central task of the state is to provide security and welfare for the population. The state has to create the necessary framework conditions so that everyone can build and maintain an existence on the basis of personal responsibility. In case of emergency, it should also intervene in a supportive manner. Only a state that is capable of acting can fulfill its tasks. Our state has increasingly lost this ability to act in recent years: On the one hand, the structures are no longer sufficient to solve the increasingly complex problems. On the other hand, the state is taking on more and more tasks. The state must function again The basic structures of our Swiss system of government date back to the founding of the federal state in 1848 and, on the whole, have stood the test of time. Various adjustments have been correctly made. Despite the growing tasks of government and administration, however, our governing body, the Federal Council, has remained unchanged to this day. The Federal Council and with it our system of government should be fit for the increasingly complex factual issues and the coming 21st century. The SVP therefore supports a reform of state governance. Yes to the people's rights Direct democracy and thus the people's rights protect citizens from excessive state power. This is also to be guaranteed in the new constitution. Cutting back on the people's rights is out of the question for the SVP. The people should continue to control the power of the state through initiatives and referendums. In addition, the state treaty referendum must be expanded. The middle class carries the state The middle class is the mainstay of the state. He takes responsibility and combines the tried and tested with the new. But he also relies on everyone being able to reap the rewards of their efforts and accomplishments. Small and medium-sized businesses suffer most from the fact that the state is taking on more and more tasks: On the one hand, it is restricted in its freedom of action by a flood of regulations. Second, it is burdened more than others with taxes and levies to finance growing government spending. The situation of the middle class becomes particularly clear when one takes a look at the distribution of home ownership: Switzerland is a nation of renters. Only 33% of the population own their own homes. The least represented of these is the middle income bracket between 50,000 and 70,000 Swiss francs! Eigenturn, however, should be open to all with appropriate efforts. The high tax burden should not penalize those who make an effort to save for retirement in the form of property. The middle class should be able to count on the state and the reward of personal responsibility here. Competent women instead of imposed quotas Direct democracy and legal equality between men and women also ensure that women have a say in politics. The SVP therefore considers state-imposed quota regulations to be unnecessary. Women make their way thanks to their competence and skills. Relations of the state with foreign countries The Confederation also has the task of representing Switzerland abroad. In recent years, however, the public's trust in the straightforwardness of his policies has dwindled. Decisions such as the submission of the application to join the EU have unsettled the population and weakened Switzerland's negotiating position. The SVP is the only party in the Federal Council that is committed to ensuring that the will of the people is respected. It therefore demands that the Federal Council clearly stand up for Switzerland's neutrality and independence vis-à-vis other countries. As much government as necessary, as little government as possible STANDPOINTS: The SVP defends the independence and neutrality of Switzerland The SVP stands up for the rights of the people The SVP fights against the obstruction of trade through bureaucratic requirements The SVP demands the facilitation of the acquisition of residential property and the promotion of building savings The SVP promotes women without quotas Taxes The tax burden in Switzerland is CHF 10,871 per capita per year. This does not even include social security costs. The Swiss pay the most taxes per capita in the world. For small and medium-sized businesses in particular, the burden has reached a level that threatens their very existence. Modern taxes in the form of fees, levies and wage percentages have contributed to this in particular. And there is still talk of new taxes. The SVP advocates not only putting a stop to this, but also lowering the state quota. The tax burden on companies A favorable tax climate is a crucial element in the attractiveness of a location. This applies to both existing and new operations. Too high taxes drive companies and thus taxpayers abroad. Low taxes, on the other hand, bring new taxpayers into the country. Unlike other countries, Switzerland today burdens companies twice: corporate profits are first subject to an income tax and then again to income tax. It is also alarming that Swiss companies have to pay up to eight types of tax, resulting in annual administrative costs averaging 14,000 Swiss francs per company! Switzerland as a tax location therefore still needs to be optimized significantly for the benefit of the economy as a whole. Improvements in the tax climate would also be worthwhile for SMEs and thus for Switzerland as a whole. In particular, the direct federal tax is to be scrutinized. Ultimately, reducing the government share helps to preserve jobs. The tax burden on the individual The tax burden on citizens must not be allowed to rise any further. It is this burden, especially progression, that is slowly killing off the middle class. Tax improvements would not only benefit the economy, but also all citizens. Today, exactly the opposite is happening: the Federal Council and Parliament are constantly looking for new ways to levy taxes and duties: HVF, alpine transit tax, energy tax, gasoline price increase, CO 2 tax, solar tax, capital gains tax, stamp duties, additional wage and VAT percentages as well as an increase in AHV contributions for self-employed persons. Short-sighted vendettas against people with high incomes do not bring tax relief for lower incomes. 20% of the population pays 80% of the taxes today. No one can have an interest in taxpayers migrating abroad. If this happens, those who remain have to pay for the state's costs. So that would mean higher taxes for everyone, especially the middle class and the ordinary taxpayer. That is why the SVP opposes the capital gains tax. Greater tax fairness through a tax burden based on financial performance is the goal that needs to be achieved. Healthy tax competition The SVP is expressly in favor of tax competition between cantons and between municipalities. Healthy, functioning tax competition is one of the most effective brakes against excessive government spending and protects citizens from excessive tax burdens. Low taxes can be used to attract potent taxpayers. Initial tax shortfalls are thus more than compensated for, and ultimately everyone benefits from the lower taxes. An end to ever new taxes and levies STANDPOINTS: The SVP opposes new and additional taxes and calls for a reduction in the tax rate The SVP advocates a tax reform that ensures a fairer tax system instead of bringing in hidden additional revenues for the state The SVP supports Switzerland as a tax-friendly business location Traffic A well-developed transport network and thus the safeguarding of mobility is an essential prerequisite for the development of all economic regions in the country. The need for mobility of people and goods has risen steadily in recent decades and will continue to do so in the future. The transport network must be better oriented to the needs of the market. It is necessary to define a transport policy based on the principle of free choice of means of transport and satisfying mobility needs. Careful handling of nature and energy are a matter of course. No mode of transport should be played off against another for ideological reasons. Public and private transport can only meet the needs together. Efficient roads The SVP is committed to maintaining the efficiency of the road, and thus to safeguarding the mobility interests of all regions and their populations. Optimal traffic flow must be ensured on the entire national road network. The SVP therefore advocates the rapid completion of the missing sections of the national highway, an expansion of the Gotthard approaches and the Al, where necessary to six lanes, and a second tube at the Gotthard. The risk of congestion during road works is to be reduced to a minimum by intensive and less costly construction methods. In metropolitan areas, balanced solutions should be sought to address traffic problems, such as fluid traffic control and local bypasses. Parking garages are to be created in the city centers. The SVP firmly rejects measures that obstruct traffic. They do not contribute to the reduction of pollutants, but actually cause more exhaust gases due to congestion. Mountain and peripheral areas are particularly dependent on a good road network. The condition of the main roads no longer corresponds to the traffic volume and there is a need for renewal. The Confederation must provide the cantons with the necessary funds for the construction and maintenance of an efficient network of main and national roads. Optimal public transport The SVP is committed to public transport that meets demand. Switzerland is located in the heart of Europe and is therefore at the center of international travel and transit. The integration of our country into the high-speed network of European passenger transport (e.g. TGV, ICE, Pendolino) is of crucial importance for Switzerland as a business location and tourist destination. To this end, an addition to the Swiss rail network is undoubtedly indispensable. The focus is on the popular resolutions of 1998. The expansion and financing of the NRLA must not be at the expense of public urban and regional transport. The article on the protection of the Alps was intended to achieve a shift of freight traffic to rail in the interest of the Alpine region. However, the strategy proved to be wrong. The SVP therefore demands a correction of the article. It is not transalpine freight traffic from border to border that is to be targeted, but freight traffic over long distances. In the spirit of the 1998 popular resolutions, this shift in freight traffic must be promoted in an appropriate manner to relieve the burden on the road network and the environment. Yes to the transport industry Switzerland is dependent on an efficient transport industry for the development of residential, commercial and industrial areas. The fine distribution of freight traffic can only be handled by road, while for long-distance traffic, rail must also be used as far as possible. Almost half of all tonne-kilometers in freight transport are performed on the road. Policymakers must not place an undue burden on this important industry. Air traffic needs airports Switzerland as a business location depends on good transport connections with other countries. International and intercontinental air traffic in particular is becoming increasingly important in this respect. In the national interest, the SVP stands for an efficient and competitive national aviation. This also requires performance competition at the national level. A modern infrastructure is indispensable for this. The expansion of airports must therefore not be hindered. In addition to work and business aviation, general aviation also performs important functions in the search and rescue service as well as in patient and supply transportation and in pilot training. As an important mode of transport and economic factor, aviation should not be pushed abroad by Switzerland's high regulatory density. For an optimal infrastructure to ensure mobility to measure STANDPOINTS: The SVP advocates the free choice of means of transport The SVP calls for the rapid completion of the missing sections of national roads and the expansion of main roads where necessary The SVP supports the expansion of the Al to six lanes where necessary; as well as a second tube on the Gotthard and the expansion of the Gotthard access roads The SVP supports the transport of non-perishable goods over longer distances by rail The SVP rejects measures that obstruct traffic Economy, business and tourism A healthy economy is the livelihood of our country and its people. Only with a flourishing economy can the needs of each individual be met and a life of prosperity ensured. Improvement of the general conditions The Swiss economy has been one of the weakest performers among industrialized countries over the past seven years, with a growth rate of less than one percent. However, in the 80s our country had one of the highest growth rates in years. The decline in growth is due, among other things, to the deterioration of the tax environment, non-competitive structures, economic problems of our trading partners and the high Swiss franc. The ongoing restructuring process is laying the foundation for better future economic development. Ultimately, this will make Switzerland more competitive again. It is now up to policymakers to support the incipient growth through optimal framework conditions and an attractive tax system. Socially responsible market economy The SVP is committed to the performance principle. Nevertheless, economic behavior cannot be left exclusively to market forces. The state is the guarantor of an order that includes employers and employees, producers and consumers. The SVP strives for a socially responsible market economy. It rejects an excessive welfare state in which individual responsibility is being pushed back further and further. SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) The SVP is committed to SMEs and trade. It does not just pay lip service to this. In recent years, it has formulated various concerns and called for their consistent implementation. First and foremost is the reduction of administrative burdens and restrictions that hinder the free development of the trade. For SMEs in particular, the ever-increasing number of requirements can hardly be met. Economic and commercial policy is made every day. Every political decision has an impact on the for better or worse of SMEs. This shows who stands by the SMEs in words alone and who follows up with actions. The SVP advocates relief on a daily basis' and has the welfare of SMEs in mind with every new decree. These include environmental regulations, health requirements or the Equal Opportunity Act, requirements of social security laws, building regulations, tax laws and bureaucratic approval procedures. Any requirement in the above-mentioned areas means a worsening for the situation of SMEs. The density of state regulations is growing: Collection of laws 1947: 9000 printed pages 1991: 20000 printed pages Annual time burden For medium entrepreneurs 370 hours For small entrepreneurs 200 hours SMEs fulfill an important social task. They secure around 70 percent of all jobs in our country. This includes many places where the work can still be directly experienced by the individual. The sense of responsibility toward employees is also particularly pronounced in these structures. In addition, around three quarters of apprentices are trained in SMEs. Thus, SMEs not only provide the jobs of the future, but also the training of the professionals of the future. SMEs can and should be offered as much flexibility as possible. Where cooperation between employee and employer functions smoothly, the state should not intervene unnecessarily. Taxes and duties In Switzerland, companies are unduly burdened by taxes and duties. The labor factor has become too expensive. There is still talk of further new financial burdens, such as additional VAT percentages or energy levies. These are no longer bearable for many small companies. It is time to finally take countermeasures here. Taxes must go down. Tax relief is ultimately cheaper and more effective than revitalization programs because it revives the economy more quickly. Tourism For many regions, tourism is of enormous economic importance. In some places, more than half of the value added is directly or indirectly attributable to tourism. With a total of 300,000 jobs, it is a major employer; in mountain regions it is even the most important branch of the economy. Costly spatial planning procedures and additional VAT percentages are a particular burden on the tourism industry. The SVP is therefore calling for an improvement in the framework conditions for this sector of the economy. Healthy SMEs - Healthy Switzerland STANDPOINTS: The SVP fights in the interest of small and medium-sized enterprises for tax relief and tax reductions as well as against new burdens due to social security laws and other requirements The SVP rejects excessive statistical efforts and administrative hassles for trade and industry The SVP advocates improved framework conditions for modern, high-quality and demand-oriented tourism in Switzerland Energy and environment Safeguarding resources for future generations and thus ensuring the sustainability of Switzerland's development is an important concern. Our country already plays a leading role worldwide in the field of environmental protection: strict limits apply and research in the field of rational use of energy and fuel as well as alternative energy generation has achieved great success. The task now is to continue this trend without overshooting the mark. Environmental protection is important, but must not be allowed to block economic development. Energy -favorable and environmentally friendly An important goal of energy policy is to provide the population and the economy with affordable energy. The energy supply should be sufficient, secure, diversified, economical and environmentally compatible. At the same time, attention must also be paid to economical and rational energy consumption. In the future, one focus must be on increased research in the field of efficient, inexpensive and environmentally friendly energy generation. The promotion of renewable energies, in particular hydropower, is of primary importance. Market liberalization in the energy sector must be completed quickly. At the same time, the line networks for transmitting energy must be made available to all competitors at cost-covering prices. Competition guarantees an optimal energy supply. Switzerland must not miss the boat on the liberalized market. It must remain an international energy hub. However, liberalization must not be allowed to undo previous efforts in energy policy. To this end, the necessary guard rails must be set and, in particular, the competitiveness of hydropower must be ensured. Yes to hydropower and nuclear energy Around 60% of the electricity generated in Switzerland comes from hydropower and around 40% from nuclear power, environmentally friendly and free of exhaust gases. Water is the most important renewable energy source and raw material in our country. Of particular importance are the storage power plants in the Alps, which can be started up and shut down again within a few minutes depending on demand, thus ensuring the necessary provision of peak energy. This gives us a competitive advantage that we must exploit in the liberalized market, especially in foreign markets. The SVP therefore welcomes the efforts to maintain and renew existing hydropower plants and to build new ones in a moderate and environmentally friendly manner. Nuclear energy is also part of a diversified energy production. No equivalent substitute for nuclear energy is available in the foreseeable future. The risk of a reactor accident is low thanks to our safety regulations. The SVP therefore rejects a move away from nuclear energy or an extension of the moratorium as long as the current safety level can be guaranteed. Switzerland must be able to keep up in research and production of nuclear energy. Solutions have to be found for the upcoming problems in the waste management sector. Confidence in environmental protection The SVP considers the level achieved in environmental protection to be good. Existing gaps are to be closed. However, the SVP always rejects new, additional requirements and regulations. The enforcement of such regulations has become an unbearable burden for many SMEs, also in administrative terms. At a minimum, simplification of regulations is possible without sacrificing environmental benefits. The SVP also calls for a restriction of the right of appeal by associations and binding deadlines for the settlement of objections. The energy-environment and solar initiatives overshoot the mark and should therefore be rejected. In the interest of future generations: A strong economy in harmony with nature STANDPOINTS: The SVP calls for favorable framework conditions for energy production and procurement in Switzerland The SVP is committed to the sensible protection of nature in the interests of future generations The SVP is in favor of measures for the efficient use of all energies The SVP says yes to the continued use of nuclear energy The SVP supports the preservation and renewal of existing hydropower plants and the moderate, environmentally friendly construction of new ones The SVP is calling for a restriction of the right of appeal by associations"
43810,200310,"SVP's mission. The mandate of the voters obliges. With the election platform, the SVP sets out its program every four years before the elections, to which it can be committed: In particular, an autonomous, independent, neutral and direct-democratic Switzerland, a lean state with self-reliant citizens, fewer taxes and duties, healthy financing of our social security systems and more security. The SVP calls abuses by their name and fights them consistently. With your vote, you are giving us a mandate to work towards these and other goals set out in the election platform. Fulfillment of the voter mandate as the primary goal. Representing voters means implementing this program in everyday politics without any ifs or buts. This, in turn, means not seeking lucrative positions and posts to be paid for by the taxpayer, because this gives rise to venality, mismanagement, and filth. But it is precisely these grievances that the SVP is fighting against. In doing so, it accepts that it will make itself unpopular with other political forces and the media. But silence harms our country and would be a betrayal of the program and the electorate. The primary goal of a party and its elected representatives must be to fulfill the mandates given to them when they are elected to office. The larger the respective share of voters, the more important these orders also become. And the SVP and its exponents want to carry this out to the best satisfaction of the voters - straightforwardly and consistently. In order to meet this requirement, the SVP must, on a case-by-case basis, take the path that allows the fastest and best implementation of the will of the voters. This can be done by working with other parties, but also by going it alone. If the voters of the SVP do not tolerate that the Federal Council does not have a grip on the finances, commits regulatory sins, constantly increases spending, drives the social services into ruin and at the same time seeks more tax revenues, then compromises of the SVP with other parties are out of place. Concordance and direct democracy. The purpose of a concordance government would be to include all the important parties in the country in the government according to their voter strength. This basis for concordance has not been realized today: although it is the party with the largest number of voters, the SVP continues to be denied an appropriate seat in the national government by the other parties. This means that SVP solutions cannot be introduced and represented in the Federal Council in a manner commensurate with their weight. It must nevertheless fulfill the mandate of the electorate, within or, if necessary, outside the Federal Council or the government. This has a long tradition in our party and government system: for decades, parties have repeatedly claimed this right. Our system of government with all the major parties can only function in the long run if each party involved is also allowed to have a dissenting stance. Anyone who shirks from answering this fundamental question and instead sidesteps discussions about questions of style is suspected of defending their own sinecures. The SVP will also have to use the instruments of direct democracy in the future if it does not find a majority in the parliaments. It owes this to its voters. The use of political rights is an expression of direct democracy. Of course, the SVP will continue to assert its seat claim because it stands by a genuine concordance system and thus also by a genuine magic formula. The record of the governing parties. Against the fierce opposition of the SVP, we are now faced with a mountain of debt of over 100 billion francs, more than the Swiss Confederation has ever had. The Federal Council and the governing parties SP, FDP and CVP are too weak to put the federal budget in order. Against our will, Switzerland has increased its tax and fiscal rates the most of any OECD country over the past decade, causing severe damage to our economy and jobs. The middle class is being sucked dry. Important contracts with foreign countries were negotiated amateurishly and concluded correspondingly poorly. We have been waiting in vain for a solution to the asylum and foreigner problem for years. The gigantic abuse of asylum with costs in the billions continues unhindered. Expo.02 cost the federal government six times the amount originally promised. Under the last SP Federal Councilor, spending on social welfare increased from 8.6 billion to 13 billion annually. Against the opposition of the SVP, a health insurance debacle was caused at the expense of premium payers that is unparalleled. Contrary to the negative referenda on EEA and EU accession, the Federal Council and the other parties are sacrificing Switzerland and its independence step by step to international interests. Instead of representing the Swiss people, our officials travel around the world highly official and highly paid by the state. The SVP as an alternative. Today's desolate situation can no longer be concealed. It is the result of bad politics and a misunderstood concordance. The SVP has resolutely fought all these negative developments for the country and the people - and fought this battle practically alone against all others. Democracy is the form of government of the alternatives. Fortunately, voters will have an alternative in the federal elections on October 19, 2003. It is the alternative to the united governing parties SP, FDP and CVP, which have brought about all the described conditions: the SVP. Fortunately, in the past the SVP had the strength to resist and present better solutions. It would have been devastating for the democratic culture of our country and depressing for the voters if the SVP had also been in the same boat as everyone else. The exponents of the SVP will implement the promises made in the present program with all their might. For the SVP and its exponents, the voters' mandate forms the basis for policy in the coming years. According to the motto ""Clear on the matter - fair in style"", the exponents of the SVP promote the democratic opinion-forming process in public through clear, factual and fair arguments. If decisions are taken in parliament that fundamentally contradict the SVP's political goals, the SVP is forced to resort to direct democratic means. The SVP is seeking its rightful second seat on the Federal Council. The SVP stands by a genuine system of concordance and a magic formula in which the major parties are represented in the Federal Council with two seats and a minor party with one seat. If the rules of the magic formula are subjected to political criteria by the majority of parliament, the SVP has all political means at its disposal to fight its claim. Principles: SVP - we stand up for Switzerland. Trust in the tried and tested - room for the new. The politics of the SVP are based on Christian and basic democratic values. The SVP combines proven traditional values and progressive achievements to form a forward-looking policy. Quality and substance count, not appearances and empty words; the performance principle instead of felt politics. As a true people's party, the SVP unites everyone who wants to work for the future of Switzerland - whether young or old, woman or man, rich or poor. The diversity of Switzerland is reflected in the diversity of the SVP. Yes to Switzerland as a democratic nation of will. Switzerland's history as a nation of wills is a success story. Direct democracy and federalism ensure that problems are solved where they arise. Individual responsibility and the democratic right of co-determination of the citizen guarantee peace, freedom and prosperity. The federal government is only involved in a supplementary and coordinating role where necessary. In this way, prosperous development is possible throughout the country, from the centers to the outlying areas. With these citizen-oriented and democratic structures, Switzerland is a model for other countries and can be proud of its development and the prosperity achieved in the country. For the future, it is important to continue on this path and not to fall into fear of the EU as a neighbor or into pusillanimity. Cultural diversity and regional cohesion. Switzerland as a nation of wills shows its strength in the cohesion of the country in its cultural diversity with four national languages and 26 cantons and half-cantons with their own traditions. Each region, each canton, each municipality has its own history and maintains its traditional customs. In countless associations, tradition and customs are lived day after day without artificial state support. Federalism ensures decentralized development, distribution of offices and courts, and cohesion of all regions despite different needs. From the Jura to the Ticino, from Geneva to Graubünden, everyone can be sure that their vote counts as much as the vote of Bern. In addition, the federal government ensures optimal framework conditions so that the supply functions everywhere and peripheral areas or agglomerations are not only dependent on subsidies. With a minimum of state and a maximum of market, the supply of the elementary goods of life can best be guaranteed in centers as well as in peripheral regions. Food, education, energy, health care, social security for the genuinely needy, internal and external security, transport and communications infrastructure are to be provided in such a way that the services are provided as cheaply as possible and with the best possible quality and breadth. Less government - more personal responsibility. The SVP focuses on freedom and personal responsibility as traditional values that have brought prosperity to Switzerland. Personal responsibility begins in the family and ultimately belongs in every area, from the economy to transportation to social insurance. It is not acceptable to call on the state for help with everything and everyone. The state must take action where the individual cannot: It has to offer protection from war and violence, and it has an infrastructure and to ensure a social safety net that covers basic needs. Wherever possible, however, individuals must take responsibility for their actions and bear the consequences. These principles form the basis for the SVP's election platform and demands for the future of our country. ASYLUM POLICY. Today, Switzerland is one of the most important destination countries for bogus refugees. The reason for this is the asylum policy of the Federal Council and parliament, which leave the door wide open to the abuse of asylum law despite the warnings of the SVP. Asylum application numbers are steadily rising, and drug trafficking is firmly in the hands of asylum seekers and illegal residents. The SVP has been fighting this misery alone for years. The Federal Council merely makes empty promises and says it has everything under control. It can't go on like this. The SVP demands that uncompromising action finally be taken against criminal asylum seekers and illegal immigrants. Our country needs a right of asylum that offers protection to those who are threatened in life and limb and not to those who come to Switzerland under the pretext of asylum in order to improve their economic situation. Put an end to asylum abuse. With its popular initiative ""against abuse of the right of asylum"", the SVP has declared war on the abuse of our hospitality by bogus refugees and criminal foreigners. The initiative was approved by the majority of the cantons, but failed by a razor-thin margin of 49.9%. The SVP sees its position confirmed and will continue to fight the Federal Council's mismanagement of the asylum system. The Asylum Act must be tightened up to put a stop to the abuse of asylum rights. People who conceal their identity in order to avoid deportation or who travel on to Switzerland via a safe third country even though they could have applied for asylum in the transit country are abusing our system. Shorten asylum procedures. Asylum proceedings today can drag on for years, from the first instance to the appeal to several reconsideration proceedings. Word quickly got around that it is also possible to force a residence permit this way, regardless of the negative decision of the first instance. The SVP therefore calls for an effective shortening of the procedure through mandatory deadlines, not only for the first decisions, but also for appeal and reconsideration. Persons whose application has been rejected must leave our country. Improve enforcement and reduce costs. Border protection is increasingly neglected. As a result, the influx of asylum seekers is also growing. The federal government is responsible for this. It must therefore also bear responsibility for deportation and support the cantons to the best of its ability in enforcing the decisions. It also has to set care standards for the cantons. This can prevent luxury services and save costs. The federal government must also ensure that decisions are implemented quickly. However, deportations are only possible if the identity of the persons is known and the necessary papers are available. Therefore, all obstacles that hinder the clarification must be removed. The paper procurement must be started immediately after the first instance decision and not only after the expiry of the objection period. Take strict action against criminals. The larger the number of asylum seekers, the easier it is for criminals to abuse the right of asylum. Around half of all recorded offenders in Switzerland are foreigners. Today's penal provisions are too little of a deterrent to committing crimes. Jurisdiction is too lax, prison conditions are too luxurious. The SVP demands the immediate expulsion of criminal asylum seekers. If this is not possible, criminal asylum seekers must be interned until they are deported. Viewpoints. The SVP calls for the fight against asylum tourism by: - better border controls. - Non-processing of asylum applications from persons who entered via safe third countries (so-called ""third country regulation""). - Collective accommodation of asylum seekers until the asylum decision is made and enforced. - Consistent and rapid enforcement of decisions. The SVP demands an acceleration of the procedures by: - short deadlines for proceedings, appeals and reconsiderations. - Paper procurement with the help of the federal government after the first-instance decision. The SVP demands the expulsion of criminal asylum seekers. If this is not possible, they are to be interned. The SVP calls for a reduction in costs in the asylum sector through greater efficiency at all levels and the setting of care standards throughout Switzerland. Alien Policy. Due to its size and population density, Switzerland is not a country of immigration. Nevertheless, in recent years it has become the destination of many bogus refugees and illegal immigrants. The Federal Council is unconceptualized and overwhelmed by this development. Because of the lax policies of the other parties, Switzerland now has one of the highest proportions of foreigners in Europe. In our country, every fifth person is a foreigner. The Federal Council and Parliament are trying to whitewash the statistics with massive facilitations of naturalization. The SVP opposes this squandering of citizenship rights. It calls for a migration policy that reduces the proportion of foreigners not only on paper, but in reality. Set rules. As a host country, Switzerland has the right to determine who it wants to accept and what rules should apply. The following principles must apply to migration policy: - In principle, there is no right to a residence permit for foreign nationals - neither for those willing to work, nor for asylum seekers , nor for their family members. Anyone who is not entitled to stay in Switzerland must be consistently turned away. - Anyone who receives a residence permit must abide by our laws as a guest. Law and order must be consistently enforced. There is no place in our country for extreme groups and their activities. - Every foreigner is responsible for how far he wants to integrate himself. However, he must bear the consequences of his actions himself and cannot expect any special treatment. Those who do not speak the national language, for example, must themselves arrange for translation or the filling out of any forms if this is necessary. It is not the task of the state to intervene here. - Naturalization is the last step on the path to successful integration and must always be applied for. Each municipality decides on the type of procedure at the municipal level. Workforce yes - immigration no. The need for foreign labor changes with the economic situation. The recruitment of employees must therefore be designed as flexibly as possible in the interests of both sides. Both employers and employees often have seasonal needs. Temporary short-term permits without family reunification best take this into account. They allow workers to work in Switzerland for a limited time if jobs are available. This will ensure economic growth without encouraging immigration at the same time. Furthermore, the development of immigration within the framework of the free movement of persons as part of the bilateral agreements with the EU must be kept in mind. The SVP rejects an extension of the free movement of persons to the new member states until the referendum deadline in 2009 has expired. If there is a significant immigration, the people must be able to vote again on the treaties. Only with an admission policy that is geared to the needs of our country can the proportion of foreigners be reduced. Naturalization as the final step of integration. Switzerland is a nation of wills, and its political system is based on federalism and direct democracy. Anyone who wants to participate must understand and accept these principles. Obtaining Swiss citizenship is therefore the culmination of an integration process. Only those in possession of a permanent residence permit can be naturalized, have sufficient knowledge of one of the national languages, both written and spoken, is able to support himself and his family, is familiar with the conditions in Switzerland and the Swiss legal system. The sovereign of each municipality freely determines which body decides on the granting of citizenship. The decision made according to the rules of democracy is final, no appeal against it is possible. It remains a right of the community to refuse naturalization as well. You can't just buy a Swiss passport, you have to choose it. The SVP is therefore demanding that those seeking naturalization in Switzerland give up their foreign citizenship when they are granted a Swiss passport. The SVP also opposes any automatic mechanisms for naturalization, especially automatic naturalization at birth (ius soli). Facilitated naturalization is available to young second-generation foreigners who were born in Switzerland and went through school here. Viewpoints. The SVP advocates a real reduction in the proportion of foreigners and demands: - No unlimited residence permits for workers from non-EU countries. - Extension of the waiting periods and lowering of the age limit for family reunification. - Exclusion of family reunification for short-term residents and seasonal workers. - Rigorous fight against marriages of convenience. - No admission of economic refugees. The SVP is calling for no negotiations on the free movement of persons with the future EU member states until the referendum deadline expires in 2009. The SVP rejects voting rights for foreigners. The SVP demands clear criteria for the granting of Swiss citizenship and demands: - An unlimited residence permit is a prerequisite for a naturalization procedure. - All applicants for naturalization have to prove with a standardized test that they have sufficient knowledge of a national language. - Anyone who receives a Swiss passport in our country must be prepared to give up their foreign citizenship. - No judicial right of appeal against negative naturalization decisions. - The choice of procedure at the municipal level is up to the municipality. - No automatic naturalization, i.e. no ius soli. The crash of the social services is pre-programmed! In recent years, the benefits provided by Switzerland's social welfare systems have been expanded excessively and without regard to funding. As a result, social spending has almost doubled in ten years! This ill-advised policy has put the future of Social Security in jeopardy. Today, important social services are running deficits, and social insurances are eating an ever larger share of the money from our wallets! In the future, the additional costs of social insurance can by no means be covered by economic growth. Not even if one assumes unrealistically high growth. The uncovered additional demand amounts to an estimated four percent of VAT by 2010. If this continues, we will reach the EU VAT level even without accession! The AHV in money trouble. With the gold initiative, the SVP had campaigned for a grant for the beleaguered AHV fund from the surplus gold reserves. The so-called center parties in particular opposed this popular proposal with specious arguments: ""The FDP parliamentary group will resolutely fight the SVP's harmful gold initiative and put a stop to the joint plundering of gold reserves by right-wing populists and leftists.""  FDP communiqué of March 5, 2002. Does the FDP prefer even more taxes to secure the endangered AHV for our descendants? The aim of the 11th AHV revision was to compensate for the additional expenditure of the 10th revision. But there are still parties in parliament who think that a further expansion can be financed: ""The SP Switzerland will support a flexible retirement age in the form of a retirement pension in the 11th AHV revision"". SP communiqué of July 17, 2000. And who is to foot the bill for this comprehensive AHV luxury? Without an additional 1.5 percent VAT and CHF 200 million annually from the SNB's excess gold reserves, this goal will not be achieved. Expansionism still dictates the discussion instead of the insight that the social welfare system must first and foremost be placed on a solid financial footing. IV - the disability insurance, which is no longer one. Since 1993, the IV has been continuously in deficit. In 2002, the expenditure surplus was almost 1200 million francs! The reason lies in the steadily growing number of IV pensioners. New categories of pension recipients are constantly being created: Drug addicts, Long-term unemployed, Welfare dependents, etc. Meanwhile, the IV makes a higher turnover than the SBB and the Post! On average, almost 5% of all persons of working age receive a disability pension. This policy undermines the social welfare system and endangers the pensions of the actual recipients, i.e. the disabled. The IV contribution rate had to be increased continuously. However, this did not have any effect, as at the same time there was a constant expansion of pension categories. Thus, an additional VAT percentage is to be levied to mitigate the deficit. In addition to the contribution increases, it is hoped to reduce the deficit of the IV with capital subsidies from the income replacement scheme (EO). Despite the grant of 2.2 billion, the negative balance in 2001 was still 3.3 billion. A further capital transfer from the EO to the IV in the amount of 1.5 billion is planned. At the same time, however, the EO, which showed a deficit in 2002, is also to be used for maternity insurance. Although the people clearly rejected this social expansion in 1999, it is now to be introduced by stealth, since it seems so easy via the apparently full EO. This makes it clear that once the plundering of a Kässeli has begun, there is no stopping its ruin. Instead of tackling the causes and reducing spending, new sources of revenue are constantly being sought. BV - the second pillar is facing a crisis. Thanks to its system (funded system), the 2nd pillar did not have any problems for a long time. The upcoming revision of the BVG in combination with the stock market slump now shows that this carelessness was deceptive. Supervision of private insurers in the 2nd pillar sector has been poor in recent years. Feltz and mismanagement have led to a situation in which many pension funds are not in the best of health. For too long, the company has been lining its own pockets and nurturing the hope of rich stock market profits to cover the shortfalls. It is likely that many insurers have used 2nd pillar assets for other investments. Massive underfunding is the norm in public coffers. Because of the intertwining of the interests of various politicians with those of the insurers, the retirees are the ones who suffer and not the ones who caused the mess. The SVP fights to secure our social services! It advocated: - the use of unneeded currency reserves in favor of the AHV fund. - an AHV revision with the aim of safeguarding the social welfare system. - an IV revision with the aim of combating abuses and securing financing. - new models for old-age provision. - a renunciation of the expansion of the social welfare system that cannot be financed. Foreign Policy. The SVP is the only Federal Council party that consistently advocates a neutral and independent Switzerland, by supporting accession to the EU and rejects further rapprochement with NATO. It condemns the one-sided focus on the EU and international organizations of anticipatory obedience and calls for self-confident and open cooperation between Switzerland and all countries in the world. The Federal Council must consistently represent Switzerland's interests. He has to resist every attempt at pressure and confidently stand up for an independent Switzerland and a secure and strong economic and financial center. represent Switzerland's interests. Foreign policy means representing the interests regarding security, independence and economy of one's own country. In recent years, the Federal Council has allowed itself to be pressured by foreign countries and has abandoned Switzerland's interests bit by bit. The SVP calls on the government to abide by the people's decisions: The people clearly rejected EU accession at the ballot box. Nevertheless, the Federal Council is sticking to its EU accession goal. Moreover, he has plunged into further bilateral negotiations with the EU even before the first treaties were in force. In doing so, he has weakened the position of our country. Strengthen independence and freedom instead of giving in to blackmail. The Federal Council allows itself to be blackmailed again and again. This has already been shown in the discussions about the Second World War. For our country to join the EU's Schengen and Dublin packages, he is even prepared, against the will of the SVP, to jeopardize locational advantages such as bank client confidentiality. Schengen does not bring more security to our country, but is first and foremost a giant step towards EU accession. Switzerland must not fixate unilaterally on Europe, but should pursue an open and independent policy towards the whole world. The SVP therefore calls for a pause for reflection and rejects further bilateral negotiations until the referendum deadline for the current treaties expires, i.e. until 2009. This also applies to negotiations with new EU member states. Promote Switzerland as a business location. Foreign policy is also economic policy and thus job security. In recent years, the Federal Council has mainly limited itself to inflating the administrative apparatus by creating expensive government agencies to promote international economic relations. This has not improved conditions for the export industry. The SVP calls on the Federal Council to substantially improve the framework conditions for the economy instead of pursuing state support measures. In particular, Switzerland's interests must be safeguarded in future negotiations with the World Trade Organization (WTO). Neutrality and good offices for peace and security. Switzerland's most effective contribution to peace in the world is its good offices as a mediator and observer. Neutral Switzerland is a safe and attractive ground for the headquarters of international organizations. The principle of openness and non-partisanship must apply. It is not Switzerland's task to judge good and evil. Rather, it has to offer its help wherever peace and democracy are threatened and the other, non-neutral countries cannot or will not help. The SVP therefore opposes the progressive weakening of Switzerland's perpetual, armed and self-chosen neutrality. It demands that the Federal Council should continue to Neutrality as a prerequisite for peace and freedom of our country, but also as a prerequisite for good offices. In order to strengthen neutrality in the UN, the Federal Council has promised to work consistently to ensure that the undemocratic veto power of the major powers is quickly abolished. He now has to implement this. The people have the last word in foreign policy as well. Switzerland's self-determination is increasingly curtailed by international conventions and treaties. Today, for example, international bodies often determine what the Swiss people must and must not do. Voters must therefore have a greater say in international treaties than they have in the past. The SVP therefore demands the expansion of the state treaty referendum. This also ensures that the Federal Council is subject to the will of the electorate. Viewpoints: The SVP calls for a foreign policy that is open to the world in order to protect the interests of our country and our economy in world trade. The SVP is fighting accession to the EU. The application for membership must finally be withdrawn. The SVP calls for a moratorium on bilateral negotiations with the EU on new dossiers and on the extension of the free movement of persons to new member states until a possible referendum in 2009. The SVP rejects accession to Schengen and Dublin. The SVP stands by Switzerland as a financial center and calls for Swiss bank client confidentiality to be enshrined in the Federal Constitution. The SVP is committed to ensuring that voters have a greater say in international treaties, and is therefore calling for the extension of the state treaty referendum. Education. The SVP is committed to high-quality and performance-oriented education. The high standard of education is one of the most important resources of Switzerland as a center of business and industry. However, the high level has been lost: Today, the school is increasingly becoming a place of education and is thus less and less able to fulfill its educational tasks. The quality of education in our country suffers from the leveling to a mediocre ""educational one-size-fits-all"" and the undermining of the achievement principle. The trivialization of substance abuse by the Federal Office of Public Health is a further burden for schools and the misguided asylum and immigration policies of the Federal Council and Parliament. A turnaround is urgently needed. Training in Switzerland in a nosedive. With its level of education, our country still occupies a top position in an international comparison. However, as a study by the OECD in 2002 shows, Switzerland is less and less able to keep pace with developments. Thus, an important resource of our country is lost. This also harms Switzerland as a business and manufacturing location. In order to restore quality education, the SVP advocates adherence to the following principles in education policy: Parents educate, school educates. The principle of performance must apply at schools and training centers. Schools must be addiction and violence free. All career goals are equally valid. In the parental home must begin... Parents are responsible for the education of their children. They have to prepare their children in such a way that the school can fulfill its educational task and does not have to focus on educational work. Parents must also bear the consequences for any misconduct of their children. This means, among other things, that they must cover the cost of substitute care if their children have to be expelled from school. This takes into account an important principle of our society, personal responsibility. Language skills as a condition of teaching. In many places, an above-average proportion of foreign-language children in schools causes additional problems. This is also the reason for Switzerland's mediocre performance in the PISA study (""Programme for International Student Assessment"" of the OECD) published in 2001. Reducing the number of foreigners with a stricter migration policy is the first step to improving the situation. At the same time, however, measures are also needed in education policy. If the children do not know the language, they hinder the lessons and can only integrate poorly into the class. Violent confrontations can be the result. The SVP therefore calls for the enrollment of foreign-language children in schools to be adapted to their language skills. If necessary, they shall be taught separately until they have acquired the necessary skills. Performance-based school. Children and young people seek challenges and boundaries. You need grades and yardsticks. In addition to learning how to work in a team is also the competition and thus the performance of the individual is a decisive element of the school. Only in this way can the school also optimally prepare students for the professional world, regardless of whether the degree is obtained in an apprenticeship company, at a technical college or at university. This also means that the requirements must be high in accordance with the degree. The permeability of the steps must not lead to a leveling down. There is no place for violence or cigarette, alcohol or drug use in a performance-based school. Extortion, violence and sexual assault must be countered by prevention, but also by punishment. If necessary, students shall be expelled from school and taught in separate classes. Internationally competitive vocational apprenticeships and universities. As developments in other countries show, it does not make sense to unilaterally promote a particular education or occupational group or to play vocational training off against university education. Everyone should do the training that suits their abilities. Graduates of higher vocational education and students are to be treated equally with regard to financing. In order to improve cooperation at the tertiary level, the SVP is also calling for the consolidation of agencies dealing with education issues into a single federal office. Today, the tasks are divided between the Federal Office for Education and Science (OPET) in the Federal Department of Home Affairs (FDHA) and the Federal Office for Professional Education and Technology (OPET) in the Federal Department of Economic Affairs (DEA). In addition, further streamlining and concentration of university offerings needs to be addressed. The central goal of training must be to ensure quality in every area. Those who have been trained in Switzerland should be among the best in their field. In order to be able to provide proof of this, it should be possible to obtain internationally recognized degrees (Bachelor's and Master's) at universities of applied sciences. Viewpoints: The SVP stands by the principle: The parents educate, the school educates. The SVP is in favor of a clear assessment of performance and behavior in the form of grades and written evaluation. The SVP demands that violence in schools is not tolerated. The SVP advocates an absolute ban on cigarettes, alcohol and drugs and its consistent enforcement in elementary schools. The SVP calls for foreign-language children to be enrolled in school in accordance with their linguistic abilities, if necessary in special classes. Vocational apprenticeships must not be neglected in favor of high school education. The SVP is committed to ensuring that internationally recognized degrees can be obtained at universities of applied sciences. In the interest of quality, the SVP calls for a concentration of offerings at universities. The SVP calls for better coordination of the tertiary level by merging the relevant agencies into one federal office. Energy. The SVP advocates an affordable and secure energy supply in Switzerland. Under the guise of environmental protection, the left-wing parties repeatedly try to burden energy with additional taxes and levies and thus make it more expensive. Thus, they do not benefit the environment, but harm our economy. Our nuclear and hydroelectric power plants produce low-emission domestic energy that our economy needs at favorable prices. The SVP therefore rejects any additional artificial increase in the cost of energy and opposes the one-sided preferential treatment of individual types of production. New energies must not be promoted at the expense of conventional types of production. Only a diversified energy supply from different sources offers security. Security of supply central. The SVP is committed to a proven and diversified energy supply mainly through hydropower, nuclear fission and fossil fuels. This is the only way to ensure a safe, environmentally friendly and low-pollution energy supply. The federal government must provide the necessary framework conditions. Security of supply must be the top priority. Efforts are also being made to generate electricity more efficiently, use as sparingly as possible, Seamless supply and reduce dependence on foreign oil. Nuclear energy as an important part of the supply. CO2-free nuclear energy is an important part of the electricity supply as long as there is no equally clean and efficient energy source substitute. Safety and economical use through careful reprocessing of nuclear fuel elements must be given the utmost importance. Switzerland needs the existing nuclear power plants, but also has to find a solution for the storage of radioactive waste. The SVP rejects the immediate phase-out of nuclear energy. as well as the gradual phase-out via a nuclear energy moratorium, because nuclear power plants are environmentally friendly for our economy, reliable and cost-effective energy suppliers. Favorable prices. Energy, as the basic material of supply, must be available to all at a favorable price. It must not be burdened with higher or new additional taxes and levies or requirements that make production more expensive. Raising energy and fuel taxes under the pretext of protecting the environment threatens the competitiveness of the economy and hurts everyone's wallet. The environment, on the other hand, is hardly helped by this. That is why the SVP rejects the CO2 tax. It is not necessary because the greenhouse gas targets can be better achieved in other ways: through a reduction in the price of diesel oil, through the better tax treatment of natural gas and by including forests as CO2 reservoirs in the calculation of the values. No environmental tax reform. The SVP rejects any so-called ""ecological tax reform"", i.e. the increased burden on energy sources. At best, this idea works in theory books. In practice, it has too many undesirable side effects. It not only leads to more expensive energy, but would cause a massive cost spike in general. The people have already rejected a system change to an ecological tax reform. Any further efforts in this direction would be coercion. Electricity market liberalization for commerce and industry. The legal basis for a general opening of the electricity market was rejected by the people. The electricity market will now develop for trade and industry based on economic developments, but without government control. The SVP is committed to ensuring that companies and households can benefit from lower prices in the future while still guaranteeing a secure supply for the population. Viewpoints. The SVP calls for favorable framework conditions for safe, cost-effective and environmentally friendly energy production and procurement in Switzerland. The SVP rejects the CO2 tax, ecological tax reforms and other additional energy taxes. Hydropower as a domestic and environmentally friendly energy must not be hindered by disproportionate environmental regulations. The SVP is committed to nuclear energy and supports the reprocessing of fuel elements. The SVP advocates an electricity market law with regulations for a secure supply and cheap energy for trade, industry and agriculture. The SVP is in favor of a moderate, differentiated opening of the gas market. The sellout of freedom and independence has long since begun! In recent years, Switzerland's freedom and independence have been surrendered piece by piece. The Federal Council is increasingly willing to give up one locational advantage after another on the road to the EU: democratic self-determination, border protection, independent regulation of immigration and naturalization, and even bank client confidentiality. Instead of achieving the promised free trade, we are suffocating in traffic, legal restrictions and so-called discrimination bans of the EU. And the Federal Council cannot be stopped: ""The Federal Council has the competence to start negotiations on EU accession on its own initiative. We intend to take this step as soon as the bilateral treaties concluded with the EU in December have been approved in a referendum. "" Federal Councillor Dreifuss 1999 in ""Spiegel"" 5/99 The SVP is the only party that rejects EU accession and thus also takes seriously the resounding No of March 4, 2001 to the popular initiative ""Yes to Europe"". The other parties prefer to concentrate on persuading the people according to the motto ""Constant dripping wears the stone"". ""The FDP sees Switzerland as a member of the European Union in 2007. "" FDP Vision 2007 ""The CVP advocates Switzerland's accession to the European Union (EU).""Position paper CVP impulses - for the start of the 21st century ""Now the government must implement its strategy of a domestic preparation for accession, so that Switzerland - as promised by the Federal Council - is really fit for negotiations with the EU in the next legislature. "" Since the Maastricht Treaty, the EU has been committed to the principle of ""harmonization"" of all important economic and political areas. Thus, it has opted for a centralized structure, which allows a lot of costly bureaucracy to grow in all EU countries. Moreover, with the eastward enlargement, ten additional, mainly financially weak countries will soon be admitted to the EU group. The cost explosion is pre-programmed, as are the tax increases. This development must prompt Switzerland to exercise caution. Negotiations on further bilateral dossiers must remain ruled out at the present time. The withdrawal of Switzerland's application for membership is long overdue. Thanks to the SVP, the people will be able to reverse their ""yes"" to Bilateral Agreements I after seven years. We need to take that long to consider the impact. Currently, the Federal Council is trying to integrate Switzerland into the EU's Schengen system. In doing so, he accepts that Switzerland will have to and effectively abandon independent criminal law and would place itself entirely in the hands of the EU in terms of security policy. Every year, our Border Guard Corps succeeds in detaining tens of thousands of people who want to enter Switzerland with criminal intentions. Anyone who carelessly dismantles border protection in a time of increasing international crime is betraying his security mandate to his own people! The Federal Council is also prepared to give up the freedom of the business location and to sacrifice banking secrecy in order to be able to join the EU. The SVP sees the anchoring of bank client confidentiality in the Federal Constitution as the only means of protection against foreign policy activism. The five foreign policy goals of the Federal Council: - The preservation and promotion of security and peace. - The promotion of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. - The promotion of welfare. - The reduction of social antagonisms. - The protection of natural resources. Legislative goals of the Federal Council 1999 to 2003 And where does that leave Switzerland's interests? Foreign policy today threatens above all Swiss democracy, the most important political achievement of our country. Increasingly, administrations and officials are trying to undermine democratic rights of the sovereign step by step by linking Switzerland to international conventions. Naturalization, education standards, production regulations, environmental laws, transportation regulations, trade transactions, banking, waste disposal, and much more have long since ceased to be determined domestically. International standards and conventions have long set the framework for our everyday lives. And this insidiously and removed from democratic control. The SVP stands by Switzerland! It has successfully prevented EU accession so far, prevented accession to NATO, prevented Schengen accession, has ensured that the bilateral agreements can be voted on again, should this be appropriate based on experience with the agreements, the Federal Council's promise that accession to the UN must not violate neutrality and the anchoring of bank client confidentiality in the constitution. The SVP has also demanded in the federal parliament that: international law provisions do not apply directly as Swiss law, but must first be implemented. the people have the final say in state treaties. international treaties and conventions do not increasingly curtail the rights of the Swiss people. Family. The SVP stands by the traditional family and opposes the creeping erosion of marriage. Especially in the age of globalization, the value of the family as the core of society is inestimable. The Federal Council and Parliament are putting this basis at risk by equating other forms of community with marriage and attaching less and less importance to the protection of life. The SVP demands an improvement of the framework conditions for the family. These include ensuring security, preferential tax treatment for families with children, and the freedom to share responsibilities on one's own. It is not acceptable for government agencies to interfere in intra-family affairs under the title of equality. Similarly, extra-familial childcare must not be prescribed by the state on a blanket basis. The SVP focuses on personal responsibility in the family, in childcare and in cohesion between the generations. Yes to the traditional family. The family as the core of the state community is an enduring value, especially in a globalized society. It ensures the basis for children's development, wealth creation and intergenerational cohesion. Those who raise children do enormous unpaid work for society and help secure the future of prosperity. The SVP is committed to protecting this basis and combats all attempts to discriminate against the family as an institution by placing it on an equal footing with other forms of community. No government-imposed division of duties. Through equality offices, women's representatives and research centers for gender studies, the state interferes more and more in the division of tasks between men and women and tries to regulate. With statistics on effort in housework, childcare and leisure time activities, the basis is created for regulations on the correct distribution of family work. The SVP rejects this interference in the family and demands the abolition of these institutions. Each family should decide for itself who will take on which tasks. It is not the task of the state to intervene here and force men as well as women into certain roles. Value education instead of nationalizing it. The upbringing of children is the responsibility of their parents from birth to adulthood and cannot simply be delegated to the state. Supporting services such as day schools or day nurseries should therefore not be prescribed by the state across the board, but should be set up specifically when needed. The impetus for this has to come from the school authorities and the responsible parents and not from the federal government. Improve framework conditions for families. The state has to support the family with good framework conditions. This starts with the legal protection of the institution ""family"". However, the Federal Council and Parliament seem more concerned with putting other forms of cohabitation on an equal footing with marriage. This reinterprets the traditional family and undermines the foundation of our society. The SVP is taking a stand against this development. She demands more security for the family in all matters: in everyday life, at school, but also financially. For financial security, tax relief is an appropriate tool. Unlike blanket subsidies, they provide targeted and efficient relief by leaving families with more to live on. Viewpoints. The family is to be supported by good framework conditions, namely by legal and tax privileges. The SVP's position is that daycare centers are not a federal task. Families are not to be supported by family allowances in the pouring-can system, but by targeted child-related tax relief. The SVP advocates an independent division of labor within the family. It therefore calls for the abolition of the Equality Offices and other offices dealing with the state regulation of family life. Finances. In the past ten years, Switzerland's debt has more than doubled due to the financial policies of the Federal Council and Parliament. Fiscal and government spending ratios have risen more sharply than in all other industrialized countries except Japan. At the federal level, the people have issued a clear savings mandate with their ""yes"" to the debt brake. Nevertheless, Parliament's spending spree continues unabated. With big words they talk about saving and at the same time they spend the money with full hands. The SVP is usually alone in its efforts to save money. The next generation will have to pay for it, because deficits are nothing more than deferred taxes. It can't go on like this. The economy must grow, not the state. This is the only way we can create prosperity. The public budget must be restructured through spending discipline and not through tax increases, which must be borne by the middle class in particular. 250 francs per second! That's how much the public sector spends on debt interest alone. That's more than we invest in education! This is paralyzing our country. The federal treasury is now a restructuring case. The debts of the federal government, cantons and municipalities have more than doubled in the last ten years and now amount to over CHF 215 billion. francs. It can't go on like this. The SVP fights for the reorganization of finances. We don't want new or higher taxes. Instead, the state must be forced to exercise spending discipline by cutting taxes. Federal spending is growing out of control! While federal spending has increased by nearly 50% since 1990, household income grew by only 22% between 1990 and 2000. A look into the future paints a bleak picture. The spending spree of the Federal Council and Parliament is constantly increasing. Through 2006, the financial plan calls for annual spending growth of 4.3%, for a total increase of 17% in four years. In the last 30 years, the federal government has been in the red 23 times! The huge mountain of debt will continue to grow. Things cannot and must not go on like this! The catalog of tasks must be reduced. The SVP calls for a reduction of the state quota to the 1990 level, i.e. to 10%. The federal government must not always be given additional tasks. Rather, the current list of tasks and the subsidy list should be reviewed and non-essentials should be eliminated. Unavoidable new expenditures must always be compensated for by cutting others. Put an end to the deficit economy. The fiscal policy behavior of the Federal Council and Parliament shows: No one is thinking of moving away from the deficit economy. Instead of cutting spending, they continue to build on more revenue. If there is any talk at all of reducing the federal debt, the Federal Council and parliament are counting on tax increases. This is not what the people meant when they accepted the debt brake. The Yes vote sent a clear signal for a rethinking of the state budget. This decision must be taken seriously and implemented. The SVP will continue to consistently reject unnecessary spending in the coming legislative period. The SVP is fighting to ensure that the federal government aligns its spending with its revenues and not the other way around. At the same time, tax reduction packages are to be put together. This is the only way to put the financial budget back on a sound footing. Debt crisis undermines competitiveness. On the one hand, the fiscal and government ratio is clearly too high and the jungle of regulations, which has become far too dense deprive the Swiss economy, and in particular SMEs, of their competitiveness and innovative capacity. In order to catch up with other countries, which are constantly worsening, the public sector must significantly reduce levies, fees and taxes and reduce overregulation. This is also the case if public revenues temporarily decline. Bankruptcies resulting from unsustainable government burdens affect both the economy and the state. Only healthy, competitive businesses secure both jobs and the necessary tax revenues. The current economic crisis is caused by the excessive indebtedness not only of the state, but also of all too many small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as large corporations. When ownership relies too heavily on debt, it is no longer true ownership. Only if the state massively reduces its spending, Reduces levies, fees and taxes and the flood of regulations that threatens to stifle private initiative and financial resources, things can start to pick up again. Viewpoints. The SVP demands consistent spending discipline from the Confederation and tax cuts to stimulate economic growth. The SVP demands the reduction of the federal debt without raising taxes. The SVP is calling for an annual reduction in federal spending with the aim of reducing the government spending ratio to 10% (1990 level) by 2006. Necessary additional expenditures are to be compensated by concrete savings. Growth-related federal revenue surpluses must be returned in full to taxpayers through corresponding tax reductions. Research and technology. The SVP stands by Switzerland as a top research location. Goal-oriented research is the key to economic success. However, research is not an end in itself, but has to make its visible contribution to solving economic and social problems. The SVP therefore calls for close cooperation between research and business. Basic research by universities and cutting-edge research by companies work together to secure the further development of Switzerland as a business location and to create jobs. With favorable framework conditions for innovative corporate research and a focus on targeted national research projects, Switzerland can fully exploit its strengths as a flexible and manageable research location. Targeted research. Switzerland's most important resources lie in professional knowledge and skills, but also in innovative research and development. Care, diligence, a sense of duty and high quality standards are proverbial for Swiss research. They make our country an ideal research location with an excellent reputation worldwide. This must be expanded through targeted research: basic research is the responsibility of universities, while applied research and development must be carried out in close cooperation with industry and must be ensured through financial incentives. Larger projects in international cooperation are to be welcomed. However, the emphasis must be on manageable national projects. This is where Switzerland can make full use of its strengths. Innovative research is promoted by good framework conditions in that investments in projects are taken into account for tax purposes and scientists can share in the financial success of their studies. Research as the basis for new jobs. Switzerland is characterized by many international award winners and a large number of patents. Our country is a leader in the natural and engineering sciences. This top position must also be secured for the future, as it creates the basis for jobs with high added value. Research projects must therefore be geared towards the needs of the market and to shape the legal and tax framework in such a way that research is and remains attractive for companies. The human being is not a research commodity. The SVP welcomes free research. However, this does not mean that human beings should become research commodities. In view of today's possibilities of genetic engineering, including human cloning, regulations are needed that do not hinder research but still protect life. It is not acceptable that embryos are created for research purposes or that human clones are produced. The dignity of human beings must be preserved, and research must serve their well-being and not vice versa. Framework laws instead of overregulation. New technologies develop faster than the associated legislation. This should be seen as an opportunity. The legislature should limit itself to creating framework laws. It cannot and should not regulate all details. Rules are of no use if no one knows them, if they are not applicable and cannot be enforced. Similarly, it is of little use if the application of new technologies is promoted by the federal government with subsidies. The example of information technology has made it clear: The federal government is usually too late and in the wrong place when it comes to new technologies. The market is the best guarantor of the broad and meaningful use of technological progress. Viewpoints. The SVP is committed to the future of Switzerland as a research location and demands: - an economic and practical research. - close cooperation between the research centers to avoid duplication of effort and save costs. - the primary use of research funds in their own country. - that projects co-financed by the private sector can increasingly benefit from government loans. - the generous consideration of investments in research and education in the tax assessment. - the participation of researchers at universities and universities of applied sciences in the financial success of their projects. The SVP is in favor of responsible research, namely in the areas of genetic engineering and stem cells. The SVP advocates the free development of new technologies. The SVP rejects the waste of taxpayers' money to promote electronic networking. Society and State. Individual responsibility and personal freedom are core values of Switzerland. The state has the task of protecting life and creating the framework conditions so that every person can develop individually and freely. However, the state does not have to interfere in the private sphere of citizens. But because of the policies of the left and the center parties, there are more and more laws and state interventions and less and less freedom. The state is becoming more and more active and is constantly taking on new tasks in the private sector. At the same time, it neglects its actual tasks, such as ensuring safety. The SVP is committed to ensuring that the state once again concentrates on its actual tasks and leaves room for the free, individual development of young and old. Leave room for the individuality of man and woman. Woman and man, children and seniors complement each other in a healthy society. Only the interplay of the different characteristics and abilities of each person, the combination of the joy of experimentation and innovation of the younger ones with the wealth of experience of the older ones lead to prosperity. People must not be excluded from democratic co-determination simply because they have passed a certain age limit. Nor should men or women be forced into a certain division of tasks or be promoted by the state in one area, for example through quota regulations. Nor is it the task of the state to ensure the political representation or participation of population or interest groups. It is up to the parties and associations to find the right ways to do this. For example, the SVP offers platforms for active party work with the Young SVP (JSVP), the SVP Women and the SVP Seniors. This creates a wide range of opportunities for democratic co-determination. Freedom and security for youth. Children and young people should grow up in a safe and orderly society. They need freedom for independent development and opportunities for co-determination and co-design. The SVP is therefore committed to a secure Switzerland and a debt-free lean state. It involves young people in politics at an early age and thus offers them the opportunity to engage in politics with pleasure and at the same time to take on responsibility. The Young SVP takes the concerns of young people directly to the political bodies. It pursues an independent policy and represents the next generation, that are not subject to taxes and state control. Personal responsibility and civic engagement are central. Drawing on the wealth of experience of senior citizens. The SVP opposes the idea that senior citizens should no longer play any role politically or socially once they have retired from working life. In today's age of changing values, the older generation, with its knowledge and experience, is more than ever a valuable pillar of society. In ten years, half of all voters will be over 50. This makes it clear that the potential and experience of the older generation must be utilized instead of lamenting the demographic development. However, it is also necessary to ensure the social security of senior citizens. There are still many retirees who live exclusively on the first pillar, the AHV. The burden of taxes and health insurance premiums often leads to the need to claim supplementary benefits. The SVP therefore calls for an appropriate deduction for pensioners analogous to the child deduction in the interest of a more efficient and fairer system. At the same time, private provision must also be promoted in the interest of future generations of pensioners. Viewpoints. The SVP advocates cooperation between the sexes and generations in a spirit of partnership without interference from the state. The SVP is committed to a debt-free and lean state in which young people can develop future prospects on their own without legacy burdens. The SVP advocates the use of the potential of all generations. The SVP calls for an appropriate tax deduction to relieve the burden on low-income AHV pensioners at all levels. F for felt. For years, Switzerland enjoyed a good reputation as a country where corruption and nepotism have no place. Swiss companies stood for quality and responsible business, and business flourished. Entrepreneurs and foreign partners could count on a stable state with reliable legal norms. The bad news of the last few years has destroyed this reputation and brought to light a web of felt and scandals. And that's just the tip of the iceberg that reaches into Parliament. While the economy suffers, some politicians make sure that at least certain managers do not suffer, preferably via useless government investment programs in certain industries. ""We demand a forced introduction of electronic administration. By 2007, it should be possible to communicate with official agencies via the Internet and e-mail. This is theeconomic policy vision of the CVP in 2003, and this administrative expansion is to be financed with taxpayers' money under the title ""investment program""? The federal program for electronic networking can be mentioned here as an example. It is true that Switzerland has a high computer density today. However, it does not contribute to productivity or to the higher educational attainment of children, as the PISA study has shown. At best, state investment programs are only suitable for increasing the state's share and for awarding state contracts to friendly companies. But they are detrimental to a country's economic development. ""'Unfreisinnig' acts, who covers own failures with state aid, requests state funds for the free economy and individuals capable of acting, abuses his position in politics to finance private activities or to avert bankruptcies, and who abuses his position in the economy to produce favorable political decisions. (...) Measured against these strict criteria, a not insignificant part of the real existing FDP elite is not simply to be described as 'matted', but as 'unfreisinnig'.""Weltwoche 03/2003. Many companies have been mismanaged by managers and still covered up by politicians. Credit Suisse had to raid ""Winterthur,"" once bursting with health, to make up for billions in losses at its First Boston. Meanwhile, the recently healthy ""Rentenanstalt"" wasted billions on an ailing bank. And the once rock-solid ""Zurich"" also lost billions in ill-considered foreign commitments that were declared to be ""strategic"". The same applies to the Vaud Cantonal Bank. It is the blindly invoked ""American"" dream of the ""all-finance group"" that has undermined the very pillars of Switzerland's financial center, which had been unshakeable for decades. Billions in holes at the expense of pension fund payers were thus left behind, while those who bear the blame for the misery were still compensated with ""golden parachutes"" even when they had to leave their posts as a result of the mismanagement. The felt that has infected exposed parts of the Swiss economy extends all the way into the national government, where the FDP and CVP hurriedly pushed through the reduction of pension fund interest rates, primarily to give Rentenanstalt a helping hand. In their party manifestos, most parties agree that Switzerland as a business location cannot go on like this, but there is a lack of action. ""The state must create the right framework conditions so that the economy can develop. But states that constantly tamper with the economy suffer shipwreck."" FDP Federal Councillor Villiger on March 20, 1996 in ""Blick"". At that time, the FDP probably did not yet think that one day it would do the opposite with Swissair and Expo. The left-wing parties do complain about mismanagement when it comes to felt and ""pension theft"". As far as the urgently needed growth of the economy is concerned, they are holding on to their own sinecures and thus cultivating their own felt: the state redistribution machinery under the guise of stimulating the economy through the internal market. ""I am convinced that the Federal Council will have to go over the books again. He must postpone the introduction of the debt brake and not immediately fall into an austerity hysteria. "" Council of States and SP party president Christiane Brunner on February 19, 2002 in the Tages-Anzeiger. This is how the left reacts when the people want to save money. The key figures of fiscal and economic policy clearly show that the federal government has not lived up to the basic principles of sound fiscal management over the past ten years. It is time for a turnaround back to a regulatory, clean, responsible policy, free of felt and ruinous cronyism! The SVP represents a responsible financial and economic policy! It has come out against the waste of taxpayers' money on the exuberant Expo and the ailing Swissair. In all these years, it has presented numerous programs and made requests in the budget debates to reduce the deficits of the federal budget. Several proposals have been submitted to the Federal Department for more transparency in stock corporations, for the protection of investors and pensioners, and for private property. Health. Leftist policies have put our health care system in a sick bed. As the SVP had already predicted in 1994 during the vote on the new Health Insurance Act (KVG), health insurance premiums are rising year after year and are becoming unaffordable for many families. At the same time, drugs have effectively been declared a harmless consumption good, and the bill for heroin dispensing is being presented to health insurers. Euthanasia threatens to become more important than the protection of life. It is high time for a fundamental rethinking of the health care system! The SVP is taking the first step in this direction with its initiative ""for lower health insurance premiums in basic insurance"" (premium reduction initiative). The initiative aims to promote competition and cost transparency should be enshrined in the constitution. The aim is to reverse the trend for lower costs and falling premiums can be achieved. It must not be the case that the majority has to pay for the luxuries of a few. Lower health insurance premiums at last! Healthcare ranks high on the public's barometer of concerns. The insured and patients do not want to pay more and more without being able to determine which services they want and which they do not want. The SVP's premium reduction initiative allows voters to have an active say in the future of healthcare. It calls for more freedom of choice in health insurance. No one should have to pay for services they do not want to use. Basic insurance should cover everything that serves to relieve pain, heal and reintegrate, is appropriate and scientifically recognized. Additional benefits are to be individually compiled through supplementary insurance. This will finally make the urgently needed reduction in health insurance premiums possible. Cost transparency instead of cost explosion. The costs of the Swiss healthcare system are growing faster than the gross national product in percentage terms: In an international comparison, Switzerland occupies the inglorious second place after the USA. Inequities and inefficiencies characterize our health care system. The majority of services covered by basic health insurance have never been tested for effectiveness, appropriateness and efficiency, and new products are mostly used unseen and without cost-benefit considerations. New studies show that 2.7 billion Swiss francs are spent on unnecessary services every year. francs are spent on unnecessary services. The transparency demanded by the SVP through a clear separation of service providers (hospitals, doctors, etc.) and insurance companies can remedy this situation. Dying with Dignity - No to Active Euthanasia. Human life is increasingly measured only as a productivity factor. The consequence of this is the creeping habituation to abortion and euthanasia. The SVP opposes this trend of judging between valuable and unvaluable life. It strictly rejects active euthanasia. However, life cannot be artificially prolonged indefinitely if the machine only keeps a defenseless human alive. Instead, palliative care (palliative medicine, nursing and end-of-life care) must be promoted: Terminally ill and suffering people's lives are to be made easier as far as possible and to ensure dying with dignity. Drug policy is also health policy. The Federal Office of Public Health's signals toward drug liberalization have borne bitter fruit. Drug use is on the rise and with it all the consequences of it: physical and psychological disorders among young people, accidents as a result of drug use, social problems caused by drug abuse. Once again, Swiss policy is aiming for a top international position in the wrong place. This development is fatal. Recent studies have once again proven that drugs are not simply a consumer good, but are massively damaging to health. Clear signals are needed here: The SVP calls for prevention that points out the negative consequences of drug use instead of offering guidance on how to deal with it. In addition, drug use and drug trafficking in particular must be consistently punished. Viewpoints. With its popular initiative ""for lower health insurance premiums"", the SVP is calling for a significant reduction in premiums. The SVP is calling for a two-tier model for health insurance with streamlined mandatory basic insurance and voluntary supplementary insurance. The SVP fights the creeping nationalization of the health care system and demands more competition. This is in the interest of better quality, greater efficiency and lower costs. The SVP rejects active euthanasia and advocates strengthening palliative care as active and holistic care and support for terminally ill and dying patients. The SVP rejects the legalization of hard and soft drugs. Trade and tourism. Business and tourism suffer the most under the burden of excessive regulation and constant tax and duty increases. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are reaching the limits of their financial and human resources. The reason for this is the anti-trade policy of the Federal Council and Parliament. Although there is a lot of talk about easing the burden on SMEs, hardly anything is being done. The SVP therefore strongly advocates tax and administrative relief for trade and tourism. Small companies in particular should be freed from unnecessary bureaucratic and statistical burdens. Put an end to overregulation. More than 90% of all businesses in Switzerland are small companies with one to nine employees. They are particularly burdened by the flood of government regulations because they do not have sufficient human and financial resources that can offset the growing burden. At the same time, unnecessary regulations restrict the flexibility and innovative strength of businesses, one of the most important market advantages of small and medium-sized enterprises in rapidly changing economic conditions. According to a 1998 study, the government-related administrative burden on SMEs has risen from 369 to 654 hours per year in a short period of time. This is an imposition! The Federal Council's timid attempts to reduce administrative enforcement costs are not enough. The follow-up costs of regulations must also be taken into account. In all those areas where the corset of government regulations and requirements (building regulations and conditions, Construction and zoning regulations, Operating conditions, Supply and disposal requirements, etc.) severely restricts or even prevents economic development, deregulation must be enforced and to redimension the administrations responsible for the jungle of regulations. Finally, the right to complain to associations also massively harms the industry. The SVP supports the abolition of the right of appeal by associations. Tradespeople should put their energy and strength into their businesses instead of wasting capacity unnecessarily on complicated and bureaucratic procedures. SMEs doubly burdened by taxes and duties. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of our economy and provide stability. They provide 75% of private jobs and offer the most crisis-proof jobs. The substance of many businesses today is being drained by taxes, fees and charges that are far too high. Implementing the polluter pays principle without simultaneous tax cuts places a particularly heavy burden on them. In addition to tax reductions, the SVP demands that the amount of fees and charges be clearly and conclusively regulated and quantified at the cantonal level in decrees that are subject to referendum. The SVP is also calling for a doubling of the turnover limit for the VAT obligation. This is currently set far too low and places an unnecessary burden on small businesses in particular. Furthermore, the outflow of capital from companies and enterprises must be slowed down by lower non-wage labor costs. The SVP is therefore calling for the long-term safeguarding of social welfare systems instead of further uncoordinated expansion. Reduction of more expensive conditions for tourism. The tourism industry is of great economic importance for Switzerland with total revenues of around CHF 22.7 billion. francs (5.6% of GDP), the tourism industry is of great economic importance for Switzerland. About 300,000 jobs in our country are directly (about 208,000) or indirectly (about 92,000) dependent on tourism. Especially in the mountain and peripheral regions, tourism is an important economic factor and employer. Although tourism has been one of the fastest growing economic sectors in the world for years, Switzerland has not been able to benefit much from it. The number of overnight stays has decreased significantly over the last ten years. The tourism industry is trying to overcome the disadvantages on the international market (strong franc, high cost level, outdated structures ) primarily through innovative offers from its own resources. To support these efforts, the SVP is in favor of maintaining the special VAT rate for the hotel industry. It also calls for a reduction in bureaucratic and regulatory requirements, which weaken the competitiveness of farms and make supply more expensive. Viewpoints. The SVP fights for a general reduction of cost-increasing regulations for trade and tourism businesses. The SVP calls for the abolition of the right of appeal by associations. To relieve the burden on SMEs, the SVP demands in particular: - Businesses with fewer than 25 employees are to be exempt from statistical requirements. - The sales threshold for VAT liability should be doubled. - State overregulation must be dismantled. In the interests of Switzerland as a tourist destination, the SVP is committed to maintaining the special VAT rate for the hotel industry. The SVP is in favor of flexible and unbureaucratic short-term permits for foreign workers in industries that need them. Agriculture. The SVP is committed to a productive agriculture that can master the challenges of the future in a liberal environment. Swiss quality products can only be produced at low cost if the framework conditions allow more entrepreneurial freedom. The SVP is therefore calling for a reduction in requirements and levies to a minimum. This is a key requirement for adequate farm incomes. The multifunctional mandate for agriculture will continue to require compensation for these services from the public sector in the future. Swiss products from Swiss farmers. Food scandals abroad are now a daily occurrence. This has shown the limits of large-scale production and export and import of agricultural products. Confidence in the manufacturer is again writ large. Many consumers are willing to pay a little more for a good, healthy product. This is to be exploited in the market. With a comprehensive declaration, farmers are given the opportunity to differentiate their quality products from the cheap imported product. Swiss products have their place in the market if they are not hindered by bureaucratic requirements and made excessively expensive. The SVP is therefore committed to reducing restrictions and to ensuring that production is increasingly geared to the needs of consumers. More draught horses instead of official horses! The objectives of agricultural policy are sometimes contradictory: on the one hand, there is a demand for cheaper production, while on the other hand, requirements are constantly being increased, leading to cost increases. The SVP is therefore calling for more entrepreneurial freedom for agriculture. Instead of detailed regulations, the state should limit itself to framework conditions. This enables farmers to meet consumer demands with healthy, fresh produce and a diverse range of products. The SVP demands that production costs finally be lowered by reducing the requirements so that agriculture becomes more competitive. This also includes the Federal Council finally enforcing the moratorium on new, cost-driving requirements demanded by the SVP and passed in the Council. Agriculture needs draught horses that are not tied back by officialdom. Improve precarious income situation. The income situation of agriculture has worsened with the new agricultural policy. Despite direct payments to compensate for public services, incomes are falling. Especially in mountainous and peripheral regions, this threatens to have a massive impact on infrastructure, trade and tourism. The SVP calls for a policy that enables a comparable income for the well-managed farming population even in the event of rapid structural change. Swiss agriculture must not be subject to requirements that go beyond those imposed abroad. The SVP is also calling for agricultural policy not to be further aligned with the EU's large-scale, low-price policy. Joining the EU would be devastating for Swiss farming families. Clear declaration of food products. Food scandals and poor-quality imported goods have unsettled consumers. Swiss agriculture has made great efforts in this regard. Today, Swiss farmers are world champions in organic production. The SVP demands the same clear declaration for foreign foodstuffs as well as strict controls of imported products at the border. The consumer has the right to healthy food whose origin can be precisely proven at any time. Viewpoints. The SVP advocates more entrepreneurial freedom for manufacturing companies. The SVP demands a fair and comparable income for economically and ecologically active farmers. The special requirements of farms in mountainous and peripheral regions must be met by a coordinated infrastructure, Commercial and tourism policy. The SVP is calling for a cost-cutting program as well as compliance with the moratorium passed by the National Council and a reduction in burdensome, costly requirements. The SVP is in favor of a clear declaration of domestic and foreign agricultural products. The SVP advocates an independent agricultural policy for Switzerland and rejects further adaptation to the EU's agricultural policy. Media. Diverse and balanced information is of central importance in every democracy: television, radio and other media are a decisive factor in the formation and dissemination of opinion. After years of leftist control of the media, the situation is bad for diversity of opinion. Reports are no longer well-founded and critical, but increasingly one-sided and monotonous. There is a lack of space for new alternative media. The state runs large PR apparatuses of its own. State television and radio prevent competition and diversity; a few newspaper publishers always carry the same opinions in different products. The SVP stands for fair, diverse competition in the media landscape. It is urgent to create free space for private media so that competition, diversity and open democratic debate become possible again. More competition in radio and television. The state only has to cover the basic supply of radio and television. This means that every citizen must be able to access programs in the respective national language with a minimum of information, cultural broadcasts and entertainment contributions at any time and anywhere in Switzerland. The public provision of communications and media services to peripheral regions must also be ensured. SRG charges fees for these orders. With fewer advertising bans, new sources of revenue could be developed, which would make it possible to reduce fees. Moreover, ensuring the universal service does not require an SRG monopoly. Third parties can also provide these. Information services can be compensated with a fee splitting. Specialized programs such as youth radio, jazz radio and the like are not part of the basic service. Competition should play a role here, and private providers should have an equal footing with SRG. It is not right if, for example, private radio stations have to struggle with legal restrictions while the SRG installs competing stations that are financed by fees. Diversity instead of uniformity in the newspaper landscape. In the print media (newspapers, magazines), the SVP also advocates functioning competition and a diverse range of products. Regional and local information must also be guaranteed. Newspaper diversity is under threat today, and diversity of opinion is even worse. A few dictate the opinion that the press has to represent. The SVP is committed to freedom of opinion and freedom of the press that is worthy of the name. It condemns careless and deliberately false reporting journalism. The most effective contribution to maintaining a diverse newspaper landscape could be made by the federal government by consistently refraining from using its own PR agents, agencies and products. The more comprehensively government and administration leave the discussion of public affairs to the media, the more attractive newspapers become to citizens willing to find their way around. By making use of the diversity of the media, they secure their economic existence in the long term. For fair and professional journalism. Journalism should be fair, factual and professional. It is to be condemned when corporations abuse their monopoly position to engage in one-sided campaign journalism and also use their power to directly train and educate journalists. The quality of training suffers as a result and the objectivity of reporting. The SVP is therefore committed to high-quality, diverse and independent training for journalists. Viewpoints. The SVP is committed to diversity of opinion and offerings in the electronic and printed media. The SVP is calling for more competition in radio and television. The SRG has to concentrate on the basic service. Private providers must be granted a level playing field. The SVP advocates liberal advertising regulations in the interest of media diversity and development. The SVP is calling for a substantial reduction in reception fees for radio and television. With the premium reduction initiative for lower health insurance premiums. Health insurance premiums have risen continuously since the introduction of the KVG. The SVP was the only party in the Federal Council to oppose the system change. In the 1994 referendum campaign, we were still assured that premiums would hardly rise. ""In favor of a gapless basic insurance, the new law brings a - albeit modest - increase in premiums. ""(...) All insured persons together will have to pay 4.5% more for premiums. Voting documentation of the Federal Social Insurance Office. The fact is that average monthly premiums increased significantly between 1997 and 2003. For years, we have been assured that the upper limit would soon be reached: ""Unfortunately, premiums will rise significantly again in 1997 because the new law will only gradually curb costs. I expect that the increase will be slowed down from 1998 and 1999. "" Federal Councillor Dreifuss on October 6, 1996 in the Tages-Anzeiger 1999 is long gone, and premiums are still rising every year! Contrary to the claims of KVG advocates, health care costs have risen from approximately CHF 36 billion to approximately CHF 45 billion annually since the introduction of this law in 1996. Francs per year. More than one-third of the population is currently dependent on premium reductions. Due to the increasing number of new tasks in the service catalog and the expansion of volumes by the service providers, as well as the lack of willingness to make savings at the cantonal level, a turnaround is not in sight. The recipes that are now suddenly being offered for correction are many and varied, but ineffective. The only thing that can help here is a restructuring of the kind proposed by the SVP's premium reduction initiative: The SVP premium reduction initiative wants: a solid and efficient basic healthcare system and finally lower premiums. a transparent healthcare system with simple structures and less bureaucracy. a new ""healthcare system"" with which citizens can identify again. The SVP calls for the consistent implementation of existing and the creation of new positive incentives for insured persons, insurers, doctors, therapists, hospitals, etc. so that they act in a cost-conscious manner. so that they act in a cost-conscious manner. In addition, the principles for a stable, efficient and affordable health care system are to be enshrined in the Federal Constitution. Security. Ensuring internal and external security is one of the central tasks of the state. The federal government is doing less and less justice to this task. The Swiss border is insufficiently guarded, the number of crimes is constantly increasing in our country, and drug trafficking is flourishing. There is an urgent need for action. The SVP demands uncompromising action against criminals. In addition, closer cooperation among security agencies is needed. The SVP is therefore calling for a federal security department. Instead of relying on cooperation with other countries, Switzerland must optimize its own resources: from the strong militia army about the well-equipped police corps to effective legal foundations. Cooperation and coordination made to measure. Internal and external security are no longer separable. Instead of compartmentalized thinking in the departments, cooperation is needed. The SVP has therefore long been calling for a security department at federal level. The Army with the Fortress Guard Corps, the Strategic Intelligence Service, the Border Guard Corps and Civil Protection could be brought together under one roof and synergies exploited. Cooperation with foreign countries must be limited to what is necessary for the protection of the country. The SVP opposes the further rapprochement of neutral Switzerland with military alliances such as NATO. Army XXI and Civil Protection. The SVP is committed to a modern, efficient and credible militia army that is anchored in the population. The main mission of the Armed Forces is national defense and the guarantee of neutrality and independence. The SVP is following the implementation of Army XXI with concern and will work to ensure that the above-mentioned principles and the idea of militia are taken into account. The necessary funds must be made available for this purpose. Civil protection, i.e. police, healthcare, civil defense and technical operations, should remain the responsibility of the cantons in the future. Border protection more central than ever. Europe's open borders and the resulting mobility of criminal tourists, as well as the growing number of illegal immigrants and bogus refugees, make the Border Guard Corps a crucial security body. Customs tasks are no longer the main focus of border control today. Due to the dismantling of border posts in recent years, protection is no longer adequate. In addition, attacks on border guards are increasing. An increase in personnel and the permanent modernization of equipment are central. People in uniform or in public service also need better protection. Attacks on them are to be prosecuted as an official offense. Those who are attacked in the performance of their duties should not have to file a complaint themselves and thus expose themselves to additional danger - among other things, by disclosing their personal details. Consistent action on all offenses. The number of offenses against life and limb is increasing. Drug offenses and vandalism are often rarely prosecuted and punished. This affects the quality of living, endangers business and costs immense sums of money. The SVP demands that law and order be consistently enforced again. Cantonal and municipal police corps are to be deployed primarily where there is a need for action in the security sector, rather than for subordinate tasks such as controlling stationary traffic. If necessary, corps should be increased. In addition, the penalties should be increased as a deterrent and streamline procedures. It is not acceptable that people are released again because the perpetrators are not expected to spend too long in prison. The population has a right to protection. Fight crime at all levels. More and more youth gangs are making schools and youth centers, but also roads and public transportation unsafe. Swiss criminal law no longer does sufficient justice to the seriousness of these offenses. The SVP therefore calls for an amendment to criminal law that takes these developments into account. If juvenile delinquents are foreigners, the expulsion of the entire family should also be considered in the event of a repeat offence. Restricting gun rights will not help crime. Each conscript should continue to be able to keep his or her personal weapon at home and keep it after completing his or her service obligation. Bureaucratic harassment of responsible, blameless gun owners is not an effective tool against crime. Effective, on the other hand, is the SVP's demand that perpetrators who use weapons for criminal acts be punished far more severely than in the past. Viewpoints. The SVP is calling for a federal security department. The SVP is committed to a modern, efficient and credible militia army to guarantee freedom, independence and neutrality. The SVP rejects joining military alliances such as NATO. The SVP demands that the democratic rights of the people be respected before important irrevocable decisions are made in security policy. The SVP demands consistent police action against all crime, including violent demonstrators, drug dealers and vandals. Attacks on public servants are to be declared an official offense. The SVP calls for the life-long incarceration of untreatable, extremely dangerous sexual and violent offenders. Early release on the basis of psychiatric reports must be ruled out in the case of repeat offenders. Foreign offenders must serve their prison sentences in their home countries. The SVP demands the conclusion and implementation of corresponding agreements. Social Works. After years of left-wing leadership in this area, the financing of social services is acutely endangered. The SVP is committed to ensuring that old-age provision, disability insurance and put unemployment insurance back on a sound financial footing. It therefore fights any luxurious expansion of the beleaguered coffers. With more personal responsibility, the fight against abuses as well as new financing concepts, the crash of the social welfare systems must be counteracted. In contrast, tax increases must be prevented. They do not solve the problem, but only pull the money, which was given with one hand, out of the pockets of the recipients with the other. Secure AHV. The SVP wants to safeguard the AHV both without pension cuts and without tax increases or benefit extensions. To this end, at least two-thirds of the income from the gold reserves of the National Bank (SNB) not required for currency purposes must be credited to the AHV. Other sources, such as tax revenue from casinos and optimal management of the OASI compensation fund, can also help to secure funds. The VAT percentage collected for the AHV since 1999 must be used in full for the AHV. On the other hand, a further increase in the value-added tax should be dispensed with. In the interest of safeguarding this social welfare system, the SVP also welcomes the equalization of pensioners, i.e. the equalization of the retirement age and widows' pensions. Ownership of the 2nd and 3rd pillars. The three-pillar principle is the ideal basis for a financially secure old age. In addition to safeguarding the AHV, the Confederation must do its part to ensure that ideal framework conditions are created for the other two pillars. Full transparency for the 2nd pillar is essential. Pension funds should change their investment strategies, Guarantees and administrative costs. For their part, insureds should be able to choose where they want to be insured. More competition would not only make pensions more secure, but also generate higher returns for retirees rather than pension funds. The SVP advocates greater tax relief for deposits in the 3rd pillar. The imputed rental value must be abolished without replacement. Pensioners in particular are being punished in a shocking way by the taxation of this fictitious income. Combating abuse in IV. Disability insurance was created to provide financial security for people who are unable to work due to temporary or permanent disability. It will soon no longer be able to fulfill this task, because there is a gaping hole in the IV's coffers. A concept for redevelopment is urgently needed. In particular, abuses must be combated and incentives created to improve reintegration. It is not acceptable that the unemployed are shunted off to the IV instead of finding gainful employment for them. Keeping promises on unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance had to be additionally fed by a temporarily introduced third wage percentage during the crisis years. This regulation could be cancelled again. The goal must now be to further reduce wage percentages as quickly as possible. Unemployment insurance and employment programs are not intended to be permanent solutions, but to ensure a rapid return to employment. Viewpoints. The AHV is to be secured by: - At least two-thirds of the proceeds of the gold reserves of the National Bank (SNB) not required for currency purposes must go to the AHV. - The VAT percentage levied on the AHV since 1999 must be used in full for the AHV, as stipulated in the Constitution, but which has not been complied with to date. - Re-introduction of the bankruptcy privilege. - Equal retirement age of 65 for men and women. - Flexibilization of the retirement age with cost neutrality. - Alignment of widow's and widower's pensions. - Pension adjustment only every three years. The SVP is committed to safeguarding the social welfare system without raising taxes. It therefore opposes any expansion. The SVP calls for better cooperation between the individual social insurance funds. The procedures are to be harmonized. The SVP calls for a stronger fight against abuse to safeguard social security. The SVP advocates personal responsibility in old-age provision by promoting the 2nd and 3rd pillars. The SVP advocates optimal economic conditions for job creation instead of expanding the unemployment fund. The wage percentages for the ALV must be continuously reduced. Disability insurance must not become a social welfare institution. It must once again become an insurance for people who, due to their disability, cannot be gainfully employed or can only be partially employed. Sports and culture. The SVP values sports and culture as important contributions to the well-being of society and to leisure activities. They are also important economic factors for our country. Neither sport nor culture, however, are first-priority state tasks. The new federal constitution has opened new floodgates for the squandering of taxpayers' money, which is not in the interest of the cause. In both areas, the federal government primarily has a coordinating and complementary role. Where principles need to be established and where the private initiative of associations reaches its limits, the federal government can intervene with support. However, it cannot be the aim to run state sport and state culture past the own initiative and to support it with tax money. Clubs form the basis. Associations continue to play an important role in society. With private commitment, they promote sports and culture across social and linguistic boundaries. This makes a considerable contribution to the well-being of society and the cohesion of generations and population groups. If the state intervenes in these areas with subsidies, it creates unequal playing fields and thus destroys the forms built up by private initiative and supported by a broad section of the population in favor of state programs. The SVP demands that the federal government limit itself to providing support where this makes sense for society as a whole and is also desired by the associations. Connecting private and public engagement in sports. Especially in sports, private and public commitment can be combined. Popular sports form an important basis for top-level sports. Conversely, the top performances of top athletes motivate young people in particular to take up sports. No other area lends itself so distinctly to cooperation with sponsors as sports. This must also be included in the considerations for the funding concepts. With the fulfillment of the SVP demand for a Federal Office for Sport in Magglingen (BASPO), this could be implemented at the highest level. As the national governmental competence center for sport, the FOSPO fulfills a wide range of tasks in training, teaching and research in conjunction with associations and other partners under private law. No to doping and violence. Doping and violence have brought sport into disrepute. Top-level sport in particular has come under fire as a result. It seems that the focus is no longer on fairness in competition, but on unfair tricks and the law of the fist. This must become different. The SVP welcomes measures to prevent and punish offenses in this area and has called for corresponding measures in parliament. As the venue for major events such as the 2008 European Football Championship, Switzerland has a particular responsibility to guarantee security and a smooth event. In this way, enough private sponsors can be found to secure the financing without burdening the public purse. Only where the business community is committed and the population enthusiastically and without reservations supports a project, success is also guaranteed. No state culture for empty auditoriums. The SVP rejects excessive state funding of culture, because it usually fails to reach the public. The last few years have shown this impressively. The Zurich Schauspielhaus is the most prominent example of what left-wing cultural policy leads to: Subsidies in the millions despite declining audience numbers and mass cancellations of subscriptions. In contrast, living folk culture can enjoy enthusiastic audiences and gets by without taxpayers' money. Viewpoints. The SVP advocates physical education in schools. The SVP welcomes the promotion of sports talent through a training program that combines school and professional sports training. The SVP is committed to doping-free sport and calls for uncompromising action against hooligans and vandalism. The SVP focuses on living popular culture. It rejects excessive state funding of culture. Did you know that the asylum misery is homemade? The catastrophic development in asylum policy stands in stark contrast to the ongoing promises of our state government that it has the situation under control. The fact is that the number of asylum applications is rising unabated. Illegal immigrants and so-called ""Sans Papiers"" (persons without a residence permit) try to force a right to stay in Switzerland. More and more drug dealers abuse our right of asylum. Why is that? Because no one really wants to tackle the hot potato! And why doesn't anyone want to tackle it? Because they lack the expertise to do so. In no other topic is so much nonsense talked and so little right said as in the asylum policy! The SVP has been pointing out the dangerous development for years. An internal party working group, consisting of experts on asylum issues and practitioners from the responsible enforcement authorities, is continuously working on proposals ranging from the migration concept to detailed proposals for closing gaps in the law. The proposals were submitted to parliament in the form of motions and proposals. However, they remained without support from the other parties, because they are more interested in fighting the SVP than in fighting the grievances. Two popular initiatives of the SVP against the abuse of the right of asylum, which were voted on in 1996 and 2002, failed only very narrowly. ""I don't want to discuss now what, if anything, could have been done in the past years.""CVP Federal Councillor Metzler in the Berner Zeitung of August 19, 2000 The SVP does! ""Asylum seekers with settlement permits are to be better integrated."" Flyer of the FDP on asylum policy. Since when have there been asylum seekers with a settlement permit? Those who understand so little about the matter had better not print flyers about it. ""Illegal migration cannot be stopped by local and domestic political means!""National Councilor Regine Aeppli in the Tages-Anzeiger of October 11, 2002. And with nice words even less! ""The asylum policy (...) has completely disappeared from the headlines in Germany. The reason for this is the (...) more restrictive course following an agreement between the then Kohl government and the opposition Social Democrats. Since then, the number of asylum seekers has fallen continuously.""NZZ, November 7, 2002. Only now, when it is five to twelve, has the pressure become so strong that perhaps the other parties and the Federal Council also realize that there is a need for action. On the Sunday of November 24, 2002, 49.9% of the electorate voted in favor of the SVP popular initiative against abuse of the right of asylum. Based on this result, the conservative parties and Federal Councillor Metzler could not help but promise that this displeasure would be taken into account in the revision of the asylum law. We already know these promises. When will action finally follow? Only thanks to the SVP the asylum plight has not yet become a catastrophe! Switzerland is not yet the asylum island of Europe! are even aware of the costs of the asylum system of over 2 billion. Swiss border protection has not yet been completely dismantled! Parliament is negotiating tougher asylum laws! the costs of health insurance for asylum seekers will soon no longer be charged to our premiums. Taxes, duties and fees. In recent years, the fiscal-to-GDP ratio has risen more sharply in Switzerland than in almost all other industrialized countries. Thanks to the financial policy of recent years, we have become world champions in paying taxes. This means that our country's former locational advantage has practically been lost. The SVP is calling for a reduction in taxes, which have grown to an intolerable level, Levies and fees. The state must limit its expenditures so that they do not exceed revenues. Down with the taxes! Government and fiscal ratios have skyrocketed over the past decade; the debt spiral is turning faster and faster. While comparable countries have seen a decline or a smaller expansion in the government share during this period, Switzerland has reached a new record level. In recent years, Switzerland's low tax burden has been virtually lost as a locational advantage. This is massively damaging our country. The SVP will do everything in its power to create a more favorable climate for innovation and investment once again. That is why the SVP is fighting for tax cuts and fewer taxes and fees. It is committed to implementing the tax package according to the detailed version of the National Council in the amount of 2.8 billion. francs will be implemented. A second tax package to improve the framework conditions for businesses and trade must also be urgently initiated. Until the family taxation reform comes into force, all families with children must also be granted an annual tax reduction of 10% on direct federal taxes. Healthy cantonal tax competition. 20% of taxpayers pay 80% of taxes. The higher the taxes, the more likely it is that good taxpayers will leave, leaving those who remain with an even greater burden than before. Lower taxes, on the other hand, can attract new taxpayers. Thus, tax revenues increase with lower tax rates. This mechanism also plays out with the cantons. If healthy tax competition between the cantons were made impossible by law, everyone would ultimately have to pay significantly more taxes. Therefore, each canton and each municipality must be able to decide on its tax rate. Fewer levies and fees. The substance of many SMEs, but also of private households, is being drained not only by high taxes but also by high fees and charges. More and more government tasks call for more and more new levies and fees. Many seemingly small amounts become vast sums. Everything has to be paid for: from waste disposal and official acts to the right to watch state television. And a little bit more every year. Hardly anyone still has an overview of the myriad of government levies. The authorities do what they want. In many places, for example, consumption-based charges were levied without any relief being provided elsewhere at the same time. The SVP is therefore calling for the level of fees and charges to be clearly and conclusively regulated at cantonal level in ordinances subject to referendum. and quantified. EU tax collectors? No thanks! The SVP wants to strengthen Switzerland as a financial and banking center. It therefore calls for bank-client confidentiality to be enshrined in the constitution. This protects the privacy of the citizen and guarantees private property as the basis of prosperity. Our country does not have to solve the financial problems of other countries either. The SVP therefore rejects the idea of Switzerland taking over tax collection for other countries with measures such as the introduction of a paying agent tax. Viewpoints. The SVP opposes the increase in existing and the creation of new taxes, Levies and fees. The SVP is calling for a substantial reduction in federal taxes and a stabilization of value-added tax. The SVP advocates a reduction in charges for electricity, Water and other daily stresses. Where consumption-based fees are charged, taxes should be reduced. Official acts required by the state shall be free of charge. The SVP advocates tax competition with the aim of reducing the tax burden. Traffic. As a country without its own raw materials, Switzerland is vitally dependent on efficient transport axes. The ideologization of the topic ""transport"" has caused serious damage to the economic competitiveness of our country and destroyed numerous jobs. The poorly negotiated land transport agreement has opened the floodgates to Europe's avalanche of trucks. Since then, Switzerland has been struggling with permanent traffic jams. Thus, the goal of left-wing transport policy has been achieved: to block traffic by congestion , thus limiting the mobility of citizens and business. In doing so, it is deliberately accepted that peripheral regions and in particular the canton of Ticino will be massively disadvantaged. Thus, not only the prosperity but also the cohesion of our country is endangered. The SVP calls for a liquefaction of traffic through an optimal transport infrastructure, attractive solutions for public transport and, if necessary, renegotiations on land transport. In the area of air traffic, too, the Federal Council must do a better job of representing our country's interests vis-à-vis Europe. An end to ""management by congestion"". As a result of the land transport agreement, the transit axes are and the lifting of the 28-ton limit. Instead of improving capacity and safety, the Federal Council is pursuing traffic obstruction policies with the aim of driving away motorized traffic. This contradicts the basic principle of the free choice of the means of transport. In addition, mountain valleys, peripheral areas and the canton of Ticino will be massively disadvantaged. Switzerland is not a truck park. Therefore, the dosage should be moved to the national border. Domestic and import-export traffic should be prioritized. Renegotiations of the land transport agreement with the EU should be sought. If no decisive improvement in the agreement can be achieved, termination should be considered. Necessary infrastructure development. The SVP is in favor of building a second tunnel tube at the Gotthard road tunnel and expanding the A1 to six lanes between Zurich and Bern and Lausanne and Geneva, as well as a second Rhine crossing for rail in the Basel area. Planning and construction of the second Gotthard tube must be started immediately, as the SVP has been demanding for years. Without improving the road infrastructure, the EU truck avalanche cannot be managed and safety cannot be improved. Structural efforts to shift traffic from road to rail are to be welcomed, but they will only work if the infrastructure is also available in neighboring countries. Investments are to be planned taking into account European developments. No misappropriation of transportation funds. The SVP continues to strongly support the creation of the fund for the revenues of the earmarked mineral oil taxes and the national road levies. The funds are to be hived off from the federal accounts, transferred transparently to a fund, and earn interest at market rates. The federal government's constitutional contributions to private and public agglomeration transportation are to be financed from this fund in the future. The federal government is not a transportation contractor. The SVP demands a clear division of responsibilities in transport. The federal government cannot be a transport operator and a supervisory authority at the same time. With this in mind, rail reform must be implemented swiftly and to sell its stake in Swiss. The federal government must limit itself to creating framework conditions for the operation of efficient and expedient connections. This includes international agreements that meet Switzerland's needs and are not characterized by foreign policy cowering. Viewpoints. The SVP supports the free choice of transport and rejects traffic-impeding harassment. The SVP demands the expansion of the existing national road network and the main roads. The planning and construction of the second Gotthard tube must be started immediately. The SVP rejects further increases in taxes on fuels (mineral oil tax and surcharge). It advocates the transfer of the current provisions of CHF 3.5 billion to a fund and their earmarked use for the road sector. CHF 3.5 billion into a fund and their earmarked use for the road sector. The SVP rejects the introduction of new incentive taxes such as road pricing. The SVP opposes poorly planned subsidies to shift traffic to rail. Projects are to be planned realistically and adapted to the competition. The SVP opposes Switzerland degenerating into a parking lot for international truck traffic and calls for a dosage of heavy traffic before entering Switzerland. The SVP is calling for renegotiations with the EU on land transport. The SVP is in favor of a competitive Swiss airport infrastructure. Economy. Only a healthy economy provides jobs, enables prosperity and ensures a functioning social safety net. The economy is doing badly today because the state is intervening more and more, imposing requirements and redistributing money instead of creating favorable conditions for companies. The SVP is the only party today that is still consistently committed to Switzerland as a financial and manufacturing center and thus to more jobs. The SVP calls for a reduction in the costly requirements, regulations and bureaucracy. It is calling for a reduction in taxes, Levies and fees and more freedom for entrepreneurs. This will allow the economy to grow again and create new jobs. Entrepreneurial freedom for secure jobs. The burden of taxes, duties and fees has increased more in Switzerland in recent years than in any other country. The increase in government and fiscal ratios has decisively weakened Switzerland's competitiveness. The irresponsible financial policy and the short-sighted and ill-considered intervention of the state in the private sector, as in the Swissair case, is leading our country in a completely wrong direction. Excessive state interventionism ultimately leads to the demise of the Swiss economy. This destroys jobs, not preserves them, as people are led to believe. The SVP is calling for a turn away from this aberration. Freedom of trade and commerce must not be further curtailed by the state. We can no longer afford any regulatory sins. The state has to provide a good infrastructure, security, stability and as much entrepreneurial freedom as possible. However, it must not interfere with the functioning market. Only in this way can companies create new secure jobs. When the state starts subsidizing unprofitable companies, it endangers its own stability. The SVP calls for a liberal economic order that gives companies room to innovate and adapt flexibly to the needs of the markets. Unnecessary government shackles as well as high taxes, wage percentages, levies and fees must be dismantled. This would also effectively combat undeclared work. Good framework conditions are crucial. The SVP is committed to a good infrastructure for business and industry. Goods must be able to be transported quickly and reliably. A well-developed transport network is needed, not only on the railways but also on the roads and in the air. In particular, the SVP calls for an accelerated expansion of the road network in order to reduce the major economic damage caused by the ever-increasing hours of congestion. Furthermore, sufficient energy must be available at a favorable price. However, political stability and security are also of crucial importance for the business location. They ensure the protection of private property as the central basis for trade and industry. Transparency instead of felt. Mismanagement and bad management have shaken confidence in many companies. It has become fashionable for boards of directors, advisory boards and management to enrich themselves from the assets of companies that do not belong to them at all. The private property of the investors is thus no longer guaranteed in many companies. Effective protection for the owner is impossible today: ownership is too widely dispersed, the remuneration of top executives is not transparent, and exerting influence on the board of directors is impossible as a result of general depositary voting rights. The SVP is therefore committed to ensuring that the amount and nature of all compensation and shareholdings of the members of the Board of Directors are regulated, of the advisory boards and the management of companies whose shares are traded on the stock exchange, be disclosed individually. Viewpoints. The SVP focuses on entrepreneurial freedom and social responsibility to secure jobs. The SVP is fighting for Switzerland to be a low-tax business location: - a general reduction in corporate tax. - the abolition of double taxation (for the company as profit and for the shareholder as dividend). - a further reduction in the issue tax. The SVP advocates that profits that are reinvested in a company should be subject to a more favorable tax rate. Additional wage percentages for our social insurances must be renounced. Undeclared work is to be combated primarily through low taxes and duties as well as simple administrative procedures."
43810,200710,"At a glance: The SVP and its program The SVP is committed to ensuring that our Switzerland remains a home for us and our descendants in the future. All aspects of our program are geared to this goal. In concrete terms, this means that we are committed to a democratic and independent Switzerland, so that you will still be in charge tomorrow; a diverse, free and cosmopolitan Switzerland that is not fixated on the EU; more jobs through fewer regulations and less bureaucracy, so that trade and industry can flourish; more money for your wallet through fewer taxes, levies and fees ; less expensive activism by the state and thus less debt and lower interest on debt; more security in everyday life and in the future through a consistent fight against crime and terrorism; less abuse of the right of asylum and immigration to the social system; healthy food and cheap energy from domestic production; a performance-oriented education policy, so that young and old are once again among the best on the international labor market; the safeguarding of social services by combating abuse; lower health insurance premiums through a purification cure for our health system; better transport infrastructures, so that you do not get stuck in traffic jams; the protection of life and the traditional family as the core of society. Switzerland as a special case: Independence as an opportunity Switzerland is a liberal state with comprehensive liberties and popular rights, neutral in foreign policy, permanently armed, and internally federalist. Our spiritual bond is a patriotism that is not oriented towards a uniform culture or language, but towards a common history and the commitment to the political special case of Switzerland, which made this multicultural state possible in the first place through its liberal order. If this conviction dissolves or if one of its pillars (independence, federalism, people's rights, neutrality) is destroyed, Switzerland as a whole is endangered in its continued existence. Commitment to the federalist nation of will Switzerland Our state, unlike almost all the states of Europe, was not conquered or welded together by princes or kings. Rather, it has emerged from a free-will union of autonomous and very different ""peoples"" - as it was still called in the former Federal Constitution. Over the course of centuries, the cantons have come together to form a federal Switzerland. In this way, the Swiss wanted to secure their independence and autonomy and provide for their own well-being In Switzerland, a nation of wills, federalism is the only way to live unity. And because federalism is essential for our country, we must take care of it. Federalism provides the highest possible level of direct democratic participation in a manageable space. It prevents a central power that rules over the head of the citizens. But federalism is also a recipe for economic success in that it promotes competition. The smaller the political unit, the better it operates. As a rule, municipal finances are healthier than cantonal finances, which in turn are healthier than federal finances. The decentralized or federal system is superior to the centralized structure. Citizen in the full sense ""The small state exists so that there may be a spot in the world where the largest possible quota of citizens are citizens in the full sense.  (Jacob Burckhardt: Weltgeschichtliche Betrachtungen, 1905) Preventing a departure from the recipe for success Past history has shown that an independent, federalist, direct-democratic state based on a liberal economic order can offer people prosperity, freedom and security. This is demonstrated by over 150 years of peace and prosperity. Switzerland is still one of the richer countries in the world, but it has lost its top position because a creeping expansion of the welfare and redistribution state is increasingly undermining individual responsibility. In any case, the partial departure from the special case has not brought Switzerland any advantages. Direct democracy as a global special case Since the federal state came into existence, more elections and votes have been held in Switzerland than in all other countries in the world combined. The Swiss can vote and elect more times in a single year than the English, for example, can in their entire lifetime. More Swiss quality again Values such as reliability, modesty, punctuality, thrift and diligence traditionally represent the essence of the Swiss. This attitude to values has also shaped and continues to shape Swiss products and services, which are appreciated all over the world under the term ""Swiss quality"". Unfortunately, there has been an increasing deviation from this Swiss quality in recent years, whether in politics, business or society. In its place came the self-satisfied urge for prestige, pomp and grand appearances. Both are poorly compatible with Swiss quality. Because the quality of our small state and its people does not consist in glamorous appearances, full-bodied teachings and an impressive ""image"". We know neither royal palaces nor equestrian statues nor sea heroes on giant columns. But for the reliable, hard-working and honest Swiss, doors have always opened all over the world - not so much the pompous main portals as the more useful supplier entrances. Genuine Swiss quality. The history of Switzerland is reflected in the architecture of the Bundeshaus. Sovereignty does not mean ""going it alone"", but self-determination Switzerland has never gone it alone in an absolute sense. It has never been detached from its political, economic and cultural environment. Trade, exchange, treaties, even partnerships have always determined our country and its relations with other states. But despite all the interconnections, Switzerland has so far never abandoned the principle of sovereignty. Since 1848, it has been clear that only the nation-state makes sense as the decisive political unit. The path of freedom and independence was not abandoned. Harmonization no substitute for freedom For some time now, more and more representatives in politics, administration and society have been striving almost obsessively for internationality. They suffer from the limitations of our small state, which painfully limit their large-scale plans, ideas and visions. They judge the small state not as our advantage, but as our fault. They almost devoutly hope for salvation through integration and think that our problems will then be solved by themselves. The gradual dismantling of sovereignty is covered up for this purpose with the fashionable terms integration or harmonization. Both, however, contradict the liberal image of society, because they end in leveling and equalization, in coercion and paternalism, in central power and bureaucracy. Thoughts about the small state ""Perhaps we decide after all that we want nothing else than this small state: a firm house, with open doors against the neighbors, with wide windows against the world.   Then the small state can exist, if it is that: firm and open !""  (Prof. Dr. Karl Schmid: Thoughts on our small state, 1964) Our state has a future The ability to solve political problems is and remains tied to nation states that are capable of acting. Only they have the necessary material, human, financial and also military resources. The most recent global political crises speak a clear language: In times of need, national reflexes immediately kick in - especially in Europe. Although the ability to solve problems lies solely with the nation-states, the EU institutions strive to concentrate as much power and competence as possible. This expansion of central power is only at the expense of democracy, i.e. the participation rights of individual citizens, and at the expense of the sovereignty of the individual states. For Switzerland, joining the EU would mean giving up independence, federalism and the rights of the people - and thus the loss of three pillars of our special case. Recently, the EU has also been striving for a common army. EU accession would thus also mean joining a future military alliance and thus the loss of the fourth pillar of our special case, permanently armed, perpetual, integral neutrality. The voice of a neighbor ""No neighbor is more agreeable than Switzerland, for which it is a principle to protect its property, to strive for nothing foreign, and rather to benefit than to harm.""  (Samuel Freiherr von Pufendorf: Die Verfassung des Deut- schen Reiches, 1 667) Viewpoints The SVP is committed to the Swiss special case with its four pillars of independence, federalism, direct democracy and perpetual, integral, armed neutrality; opposes the attempts of self-serving politicians and the administration to abandon the special case under the pretext of integration and harmonization; wants a federal state capable of acting as the best means of solving political problems. Federalism brings proximity to citizens and lower government spending. Citizens and the state: Democratic self-determination instead of state omnipotence Globalization and the resulting increase in international integration are leading to ever greater pressure for the internationalization of law, centralization and registration. Federalism and democratic self-determination are threatened. Citizens are supposed to have everything disclosed and registered by the federal government or even by international orga-nisations under the guise of security and efficiency. Democratic rights are being restricted, and regulations are to replace self-determination. The cantons and municipalities hardly make any decisions themselves any more, but mainly enforce the law of the Confederation. And the citizens are simply supposed to approve the decisions. Federalism promotes competition and efficiency Federalism means competing with other constituent states, as well as with foreign countries, with one's ideas and talents, financial resources and manpower. Analogous to a free market economy, citizens should be free to choose which services, tax rates, school systems and legal regulations they want to use. The resulting competition between cantons creates - analogous to the market economy - positive effects such as innovation, low taxes, deregulation and efficiency. Federalism is criticized by all those who see it as an obstacle to EU accession or as a threat to their centralization goals. They demand the abolition of the majority of the cantons and claim that the cantons must work better together and not against each other. However, there can be no talk of a reciprocal relationship. The cantonal cooperation functions excellently where it is necessary. This is shown, for example, by the police concordats. Federalism ensures that cooperation only takes place where it is necessary and that not all cantons, from the border city of Geneva to the mountainous canton of Graubünden, are lumped together. Legal standardization is to be welcomed where it makes sense. However, it is primarily up to the cantons to seek cooperation. Any interference from the international side in the federal organization and the cantonal tax sovereignty must therefore be strictly rejected. Decisions at the community level - citizen-oriented and appropriate Switzerland once opted for democracy and federalism, i.e. for a flat distribution of power. As a result, decisions are made as decentrally as possible at and by the citizen. The smallest political unit and the one closest to the citizen is the municipality. This is not simply the smallest executive body, but the decision-making level closest to the citizen. The more decisions are made at the federal level, the less citizen-oriented and appropriate they threaten to become. The cantons and municipalities should therefore not allow themselves to be degraded to the status of executive bodies for longer and longer, but are called upon to make use of their right to self-determination, but also to bear the responsibility for it. For example, it cannot be up to the federal government to determine how many daycare places must be available in a community, when the post office is open, and how high water rates are. All these things are to be decided at the community level, taking into account local needs. The Confederation should adhere to the principle of subsidiarity and limit itself to those tasks which it performs best and most efficiently. The same principle shall apply to the mergers of municipalities. The communities themselves should decide whether and to what extent they want to join forces. This ensures that mergers only take place where they make sense and the population is behind them. The dictated ""fusionitis"" over the heads of those affected contradicts our basic democratic principles and undermines the proven and functioning federalism. The right of initiative in Switzerland is unique worldwide and distinguishes our direct democracy. Individual responsibility and democracy instead of state power There is a growing tendency to have the state accompany and control people from the cradle to the grave. Wherever an accident occurs, there is a call for a new law or government intervention. The state is supposed to secure and guarantee everything. Nothing is left to one's own responsibility, nothing is left to one's own initiative. The self-responsible citizen is to be replaced by the well-behaved citizen who waits for orders. Politicians criticize citizens for taking a referendum, courts disregard constitutional principles and try to curtail citizens' democratic rights. These attempts to undermine democratic rights and place the judiciary above democracy must be stopped. Viewpoints The SVP opposes international interference in Swiss domestic affairs and Switzerland's federalist system; demands that the Federal Council and the administration refrain from interfering in referendum battles; fights against centralization tendencies and the expansion of the federal government's tasks; rejects municipality fusionitis imposed from above; defends the democratic rights of citizens; calls for the strengthening of freedom of expression through the repeal of the racism penal norm and the abolition of the Federal Commission against Racism. Foreign policy: cosmopolitan, self-confident policy of interests For years, it has been repeated like a prayer mill that Switzerland is pursuing a policy of sealing itself off from other countries. Anyone who claims this is either familiar with other countries or with Switzerland, or both. Our country has always had close economic and cultural ties with foreign countries. Compared to other countries, Switzerland is extraordinarily open to the world. The European Union is a good and important partner for us. But not the only one. For far too long, our government has stared like a rabbit in front of a snake at Brussels and the European area, overlooking the fact that the most dynamic markets are currently in East Asia and the USA. Self respect brings respect The SVP wants an independent and self-confident Switzerland. If you don't have self-respect, you can't expect respect from the other person. As true patriots, we have never shied away from emphasizing and preserving Switzerland's assets. These include perpetual, integral and armed neutrality, direct democracy, federalism, municipal autonomy, independent currency and fiscal sovereignty. We understand foreign policy as Swiss interest policy. Every sensible and successful country keeps it that way. That is why the SVP has repeatedly criticized poorly negotiated international treaties. Liberation from the corset of international treaties and regulations It is becoming increasingly common for Switzerland to adopt international regulations and conventions and, with the blessing of the parliamentary majority, to deprive the people of a say in the matter - for all time. Thus, federalism is continuously undermined via international conventions. For example, the conventions on racism, on the rights of the child, on the right to education, on the Alps, etc. Only when a convention does not suit the political majority, as in the case of drugs, for example, do they suddenly find ways to undermine it. It is part of our democracy that every decision can be put up for discussion at any time and, if necessary, corrected by the sovereign. This right of the sovereign is increasingly being suspended by means of international law. Strange things from the ex-foreign minister ""Safeguarding the national interest cannot be the only guiding principle of foreign policy action.""  (Foreign Policy Report of the Federal Council under the leadership of Joseph Deiss [CVP], 15. 11 . 2000) Against vanity and profiling addiction The SVP has always called for reliability and predictability in Swiss foreign policy Unfortunately, in recent years, instead of the proven restraint, more and more know-it-all attitude, schoolmastering and interference have become widespread. One-sided and moralizing partisanship is a way of upsetting other states and angering trade partners. Personal profiling, the desire for congress tourism and the vanity of numerous politicians should once again be subordinated to the interests of our citizens. Swiss President Addicted to Prestige ""The EU has received us in Brussels with very special honors, which is otherwise reserved for great powers such as the USA or China.  ""(President of the Swiss Confederation Joseph Deiss in ""Blick"", 21. 5. 2004) Withdraw EU accession application Thanks to the SVP, Switzerland has taken the bilateral route vis-à-vis the EU. With the agreements now in place, all important dossiers with the European Union have now been clarified. Thus, EU accession is off the table and further bilateral packages, as well as a rapprochement in the form of a framework agreement, are not an issue. If our administration continues to search for negotiating items with binoculars and magnifying glasses, this will weaken our position. Therefore, clarity must finally be created in Brussels and the disastrous EU accession application of 1992 must be withdrawn. For the EU has changed massively in recent years: From a loose community committed primarily to economic liberalization, a kind of ""superstate"" has emerged with the goal of political unification and a common foreign, security and domestic policy, as well as a single currency. The EU has expanded rapidly and no longer seems to know its borders. Where is Europe headed? Beyond the Bosporus and the Urals? Do Islamic Mediterranean states such as Morocco, Tunisia or Turkey also belong to the ""European area""? Where the EU is to end up, none of the architects of Europe knows exactly. This must continue to make us critical. With the exception of the SVP, all parties in the Federal Council are striving to join the EU in the medium term. In the National Council chamber, these parties are even already placing the EU flag on an equal footing with the Swiss flag. The SVP consistently rejects EU accession and demands the withdrawal of the EU accession application. Exposing disadvantages of EU membership Switzerland must also remain competitive with the EU. Running after, aping and following has never been a recipe for success in our country. We want to solve our problems independently and therefore need our own legislation in a sovereign state capable of action. Anyone who believes that we could better deal with our domestic problems by joining the EU is barking up the wrong tree. Because the EU states have not mastered a single one of the tasks that we can supposedly only solve with the help of this union: Debt economy, unemployment, sluggish growth, economic liberalization, sprawling welfare state, education misery, crime, asylum abuse and mass immigration. EU membership would bring severe disadvantages: lower wages, higher interest rates, higher rents and mortgage rates, additional value added taxes, premiums and levies. In addition, there would be net payments to Brussels in the billions, a political euro instead of a stable franc, and the loss of banking secrecy with serious consequences for the financial center. In terms of state policy, accession to the EU meant the almost complete surrender of self-determination. The four pillars of our political identity - independence, federalism, people's rights and perpetual, integral, armed neutrality - would have to be abandoned. Unemployment in the EU is significantly higher than in Switzerland. SVP - the neutrality party Perpetual, integral and armed neutrality still offers the best survival strategy for a small state. It protects us from war enthusiasm, media manipulation, hasty partisanship, and caving in to pressure. It sets tight limits on the elites' desires for grandeur, media appearances, applause and fame. It allows us to provide impartial help where it is really needed. In the age of international terrorism, perpetual, integral and armed neutrality offers us greater security than the policy of constant interference. That is why this proven state maxim makes our world a bit more peaceful and must not be abandoned lightly. But it needs steadfast, self-confident and intelligent politicians, diplomats and military leaders. In contrast to the other parties, the SVP has resolutely supported perpetual, integral and armed neutrality in recent years. It has become the real neutrality party. Helpless development aid The billions in costs of our relations with foreign countries are largely removed from discussion under the terms of ""openness,"" ""justice,"" and ""international solidarity."" A look back at decades of development aid shows that the billions have had no lasting effect. Rather, countless funds have ended up in the hands of corrupt governments that have every interest in not promoting the country's development in order to get more payments into their pockets. Significant portions of development aid, and thus of our tax money, also flow into the bureaucracy of international aid organizations. Development aid often merely promotes the politicization of the economy, because instead of leading to productive activity, it leads to a distribution struggle for aid goods. The regular arrival of money from abroad cements a fa-talistic attitude of acceptance among the recipients and prevents people from taking their fate into their own hands. Switzerland would probably still be a developing country today if it had been able to rely on aid from outside as the former ""poorhouse of Europe"". The goal must be to help people to help themselves and thus to become independent in the future. The SVP therefore demands that both payments to international organizations and development aid be reviewed far more critically than has been the case to date. The Me rcedes Index ""There is a clear correlation between the amount of development aid and the number of Mercedes sedans in the leadership of African countries.   For example, the Kenyan budget for 2005/2006 earmarked 5.3 million dollars for the purchase of a new Mercedes limo for the president's office. Another 5 million dollars are earmarked for the maintenance of the existing vehicle fleet. The majority of the population sees nothing of the development aid money.  Today, an estimated 100,000 Africans have assets of $680 billion, while more than 300 million Africans have to get by on 75 cents a day, despite massive development aid.""  (""Weltwoche"", 27/2005) Two contrasting examples: Micronesia and Hong Kong The archipelago of Micronesia in the Pacific became a trust territory of the USA in 1945 and was immediately supplied from the mother country. This led to the collapse of all agricultural and commercial activity. In contrast, Hong Kong has become one of the most prosperous places in the world without any development aid, despite the most meager and cramped land conditions - thanks to a market economy, free trade, low taxes and a balanced budget. Viewpoints The SVP calls for a foreign policy that is open to the world and serves the interests of its own population; calls for a move away from unilateral activism, which jeopardizes the tried and tested state maxim of integral, perpetual and armed neutrality; calls for the special character of Swiss neutrality (integral, perpetual and armed) to be enshrined in the Federal Constitution as the supreme maxim of Swiss foreign policy; rejects Switzerland's institutional ties to the EU (framework treaty) as well as accession and demands the withdrawal of the application for EU membership; calls for the greatest possible restraint when adopting international legal provisions, combined with a close examination of whether their compatibility with the Swiss legal system is guaranteed; calls for an extension of the state treaty referendum; opposes any automatism with regard to the free movement of persons when new member states join the European Union; calls for a rigorous review of the efficiency of our development aid; calls for development aid to be made dependent on the recipient countries' willingness to cooperate. Taxes and duties:  More for the citizen, less for the state Like all Western European countries, Switzerland has been living beyond its means for years. Although more and more taxes are being imposed on citizens, they are no longer able to cover government spending. The ever-increasing responsibilities of the state have driven up taxes and bloated the bureaucracy. This hinders economic competitiveness, leads to sluggish growth and thus to rising unemployment and declining prosperity. The Swiss authorities have also recently introduced more and more new, additional taxes: performance-based heavy vehicle fee (LSVA), increase in value-added taxes, taxation of energy, higher taxes on tobacco and alcohol, etc. The state is taking more and more money out of the pockets of its citizens. Taxes down! A thriving, competitive economy is only possible if citizens and companies can once again dispose more freely of their money. Today, we have to work more than half of the year for compulsory government charges (taxes, premiums, levies and fees). This means that more than half of the gross national product is no longer freely available to citizens. Which means nothing other than that every percent tax increase hurts twice. Relief can only be achieved through low taxes and charges for citizens and less spending by the public sector. This renunciation creates more private investment, more jobs, more growth, more consumption and thus more prosperity for all. The SVP is committed to this with a sense of reality and backbone. Because this is the only way to get back on the growth path. The economy must grow, not the state. SVP representatives know that every franc spent by the state must first be earned by the economy and each and every one of us. That is why the SVP consistently opposes all new taxes, levies and fees and instead calls for tax relief. That is why it supports healthy cantonal tax competition, but also corporate tax reforms. It cannot be that entrepreneurs have to pay tax on profits twice, once as profit and the second time as income. The goal must be to rank among the most attractive business locations in an international comparison. Therefore, the SVP also demands the exemption of companies from direct federal tax. Prevent eight new taxes from the left Those who work or have worked all their lives, those who provide for themselves and their families, those who have saved a little money, are more and more the losers. Because the leftists are out to get your paycheck and your bank account. According to the Tages-Anzeiger of August 13, 2004, the president of the SP Switzerland is planning no less than seven new taxes: further wage percentages for employees, further wage percentages for employers, inheritance tax, capital gains tax, levies on nuclear power, luxury tax, gift tax and wealth tax. Not to mention that the left, of all parties, is also advocating an increase in value-added tax, even though this would hit the very people the left claims to represent the most, namely the poorer households. This is how the redistributors and state profiteers destroy our national and international competitiveness This is how jobs, growth and prosperity are lost. Because every tax increase, every new fee takes billions away from the economy and from each of us individually and thus destroys jobs. The SVP stands up for those who are capable and willing to work. For women and men who know where the money is earned, who provide for themselves and their families instead of living at the taxpayers' expense. It therefore opposes efforts to squeeze even more out of citizens' pockets, including the planned increase in the HVF for 2008. A l iberal external view ""The USA, Germany and Switzerland are basically socialist countries.  (...) If the state controls almost 50 percent of income through taxation and redistribution, that means it controls almost half of the resources of the products and services.  I call that socialism, don't you? "" (Nobe l Prize winner Milton Friedman, ""Facts "", 6/18/1998). Stop punishing the middle class! Performance must be worthwhile again. Today's tax system penalizes the middle class that is willing to perform. The strong progres-sion burdens this one the most, and again and again new fees are raised, which hit above all this part of the population. The middle class is thus bearing the brunt of the rising public spending ratio. In no other industrialized country in the world has the state's share of GDP increased as much as in Switzerland since 1990. As a result, the fiscal quota (the ratio between all tax revenues and gross domestic product) was already higher than that of the USA and Japan in 2004. In Switzerland, it was 29.4 percent at that time. This does not even include the premiums for occupational pension plans and health insurance. This means that every year citizens have to work until almost the summer vacations just to satisfy the state's tax appetites. In former times, in the ""Dark Ages"", people had to pay a ""tithe"" - today this ""tithe"" has tripled. Including all social insurance schemes, Switzerland today has a compulsory levy ratio of around 60 percent. What are we still paying taxes for? In addition to taxes, fees have also increased markedly since 1990, by more than 80 percent. Swiss households and businesses are now charged more than CHF 23 billion annually. Under the title of environmental protection and consumption-oriented fees, more and more and higher fees are being charged. This is not about steering, as specified, but about higher revenues for the state treasury. The state is massively increasing fees, premiums and taxes without lowering taxes in return. Non-tax revenues increased more strongly than tax revenues in all cantons except Schwyz and Zug. This was the most convenient way for the federal, cantonal and municipal authorities to obtain new revenues by circumventing tax increases (and thus bypassing the electorate). In view of this massive increase in charges for private households and companies, the question gradually arises as to why we actually still have to pay taxes. Viewpoints The SVP consistently opposes all new and increases in existing taxes, fees and compulsory levies; calls for tax relief for the middle class through tax cuts and a mitigation of progression; calls for the abolition of stamp duty; calls for the abolition of double taxation of corporate profits and the exemption of companies from direct federal tax; advocates tax competition among cantons and municipalities in the interest of a lower tax burden. Business and trade: It's regulation - says the bureaucrat Against unnecessary regulations Companies and businesses are plagued by government regulation and their ability to perform and compete is threatened. Jobs are at risk due to an increasing flood of laws and regulations, as well as complicated accounting procedures, such as for value-added tax. A corset of requirements in the areas of construction, space planning, business management, and supply and disposal restricts or even stifles economic development. That is why the SVP is fighting for better conditions: for lower taxes against double taxation of company profits, for favorable interest rates, cheap energy, faster and simpler approval procedures and, in general, for less bureaucracy and simpler administration. Of the nearly 4 million jobs in Switzerland, three quarters are in SMEs, i.e. small and medium-sized enterprises with fewer than 250 employees. SMEs thus form the backbone of our national economy. They in particular are dependent on a good business location - otherwise they may quickly leave our country. The SVP, as the most competent representative of business and industry, knows this: among its representatives in parliament, one third are entrepreneurs and tradespeople. If you add the farmers and the self-employed lawyers, it is even two-thirds of the group who struggle with the unspeakable administrative flood in their business every day. Unnecessary regulations make business more difficult for our SMEs, which form the backbone of the Swiss economy. More market, less intervention and felt The SVP vigorously opposes the creeping introduction of socialist, planned economy ideas into Swiss economic life. It wants more market in business and industry and therefore opposes coercive state regulations and interventionism. The right to complain by associations is increasingly being misused for interventions that prevent growth and prosperity, and should therefore be abolished. It is not acceptable that the interest of the few is sacrificed to the interest of the many. Otherwise, we will prevent necessary investments in the future and saw off the branch on which we are all sitting. The SVP has already achieved initial successes in limiting the right of associations to complain in parliament, but the goal has not yet been reached. Government regulations should be dismantled whenever possible. For example, SUVA's monopoly is now obsolete. The number of compulsorily insured persons in SUVA is decreasing year by year. Nevertheless, administrative costs are four times higher than for other social insurance schemes. More market would bring a more efficient use of funds and thus a more business-friendly insurance, and a scandal like the SUVA real estate affair could probably be avoided. Bureaucracy burdens companies More and more bureaucratic requirements and regulations burden the working middle class and the trade. Today, each of the 300,000 Swiss SMEs has to deal with 650 hours of unpaid paperwork. In 1986, the figure was 370 hours. That is an unproductive cost of 7 billion francs a year. The SUVA scandal The real estate scandal clearly revealed SUVA's weaknesses. In filling executive positions and awarding contracts, party-political entanglements take precedence over competence.

Securing jobs We still have comparatively low unemployment. However, a high level of base unemployment has become established in recent years compared to the past. Even in phases of economic boom, unemployment no longer falls by a large margin. This is due to the fact that the state takes more money out of the economy and the population every year, while at the same time the left and the unions ensure with their demands that labor costs the companies more and more. Thus, companies lack the resources to create new jobs. The large number of unqualified foreigners also contributes significantly to the problem. The trade unions praise themselves as defenders of the interests of the employees. With their demands, however, they have eliminated more jobs than globalization. With their policy of exorbitant wage demands and strikes, they are doing everything they can to bring the recovery back to its knees and take the wind out of the economy's sails. In doing so, they ultimately drive their members into dependence on strike funds, unemployment insurance and social welfare. Every effort must be made to make these mechanisms transparent. For a strong financial center The Swiss financial center generates a large part of Switzerland's prosperity. This sector accounts for 10 percent of tax revenues, 14 percent of value added and 5 percent of employment. This strength must not be sacrificed, even under pressure from the EU or the OECD or from foreign competing financial centers. The domestic and foreign clients of our financial center need the guarantee that discretion and privacy will continue to be respected in this country. That is why the SVP is committed to ensuring that bank client confidentiality is not weakened further. Restrictions also hinder tourism Tourism with its numerous jobs is of great importance for the Swiss economy. The unique scenic beauty of our country is contrasted by unfavorable factors such as a strong franc, high costs or outdated structures. In order for the industry to be able to continue to come up with innovative offers on its own, or even more so, the SVP supports the preservation of the export-oriented reduced VAT rate for the hotel industry. Bureaucratic and regulatory requirements, on the other hand, weaken the competitiveness of companies and make supply more expensive. Viewpoints The SVP fights for more freedom and less regulation for our businesses; demands the abolition of the right to appeal by associations; demands a simplification of the VAT and an exemption of businesses from the direct federal tax; demands an exemption from the statistical burden for small businesses; advocates for the special VAT rate for the hotel and restaurant industry as well as a simplification of the enforcement of the VAT, which today hinders innovative offers in tourism. The beauty of Switzerland as a tourist destination. Finances:  The Fairy Tale of the ""Savings Frenzy Figures are incorruptible: the fiscal situation of our country is desolate. Although there is constant talk of savings, government spending continues to rise steadily. From 2006 to 2010, expenditure in the federal government's regular accounts will increase by 19 percent. This is despite all the so-called savings and relief programs. This is an average of 4.5 percent per year, which is more than economic growth and inflation. Projected 2010 spending is nearly double what it was in 1990, but this consistent spending growth is widely denied. The fairy tale is being spread that the state is saving money, spending is being reduced, the belt is being tightened. Transparency is deliberately avoided. The leftists talk about ""saving to the bone"" and ""starving the state"". These statements are false. The federal budget has doubled in twenty years. Debt mountain despite debt brake From the founding of our federal state in 1848 to 1990 - in other words, in 142 years - the federal government accumulated 38.5 billion in debt. Over 90 billion was added in the following fifteen years alone! At the end of 2005, the federal government's debt mountain had grown to 130.3 billion. If the debts of cantons and municipalities are included, the total is 250 billion. This represents an increase of over 25 billion between the years 2001 and 2006 for the federal government alone. And all this is happening despite the ""debt brake"" in favor of a balanced budget, which 84 percent of voters approved in December 2001. This is happening despite the fact that the Federal Council has set the restructuring of the federal finances as its top legislative goal for 2003-2007. Anyone who talks of ""austerity mania"" or ""austerity hysteria"" here has lost all touch with reality. The opposite is true: we constantly live beyond our means and go shopping with our children's credit cards. Under nice-sounding words like ""social"" and ""solidarity"", the leftists and their fellow travelers are imposing an irresponsible debt and tax burden on future generations. After all, today's taxes are tomorrow's taxes. Increase in government spending soon higher than gross domestic product From 1990 to 2003, government spending and social welfare grew at an annual rate of 4.5 percent, more than twice as fast as nominal GDP (2.1 percent). If government spending and social services continue to grow at this pace, they will exceed nominal GDP in twenty years. Are we going the ""German way""? The SVP wants to stop this devastating development while we are still able to do so. We do not have to first repeat the mistakes made in Germany and then embark on a laborious reversal process. In the past decades, it was a matter of course for companies and businesses in the economy to provide higher services at lower costs. In contrast, the federal government has simply covered up all its problems with money over the past decades. The two SVP Federal Councillors Schmid and Blocher have shown in their departments that real savings are also possible in the state. What is possible in the Defense Department and the Justice and Police Department must also be possible in the other departments. After all, it's about money that is being taken away from the economy and from citizens. Plug billions in holes in federal pension funds The pension funds of the federal government and its government-owned enterprises are in a catastrophic state. This is despite the fact that the federal government has already spent 34 billion since 1998 on the extraordinary restructuring of the individual funds - both its own Publica and the pension funds of SBB, Swiss Post, Skyguide and RUAG. At the end of 2004, the SBB pension fund had around 2,500 more pension recipients than contributors. The coverage gap amounts to 2.4 billion, which means that all rail passengers would have to pay a surcharge of 10 francs on every ticket purchased for a whole year without traveling less! In the case of the Swiss Post pension fund, the coverage gap is as high as 3.5 billion. In addition, the federal government and its government-owned companies are resorting to early retirement and transfer to the disability insurance scheme, for which the taxpayers will have to foot the bill. Pension benefits have long since fallen short of the contributions and urgently need to be corrected. The SVP is not prepared to impose further restructuring measures on the taxpayer. This person must already pay for his own pension. The same must apply to the federal pension funds: Those who retire early should accept a pension reduction. Restore state budget A recovery of the public budget requires concrete measures. The first step is to put in order all the new cheeses and the various types of transfer payments that have been used to disguise the creation of new expenditures in recent years. Only when there is transparency will it be possible to obtain an overview of expenditures. In a second step, these expenditures are then to be capped. Deficits must not be ""remedied"" by increasing revenues. The state must be forced to exercise spending discipline by cutting taxes. Legislation without simultaneous assurance of funding for the corresponding tasks must be opposed. The current list of tasks and the list of subsidies must be reviewed and superfluous items must be eliminated Unavoidable new expenditures must always be compensated for by eliminating others. Viewpoints The SVP calls for full transparency regarding the federal government's financial situation and the presentation of a plan to reduce tasks with the aim of returning the government share to the 1990 level; calls for the introduction of a financial referendum at federal level; advocates a tightening of the debt brake and a reduction in debt to the level of 2001, when the debt brake came into force; calls for a relief program to eliminate the deficits in the years 2008-2010. Security: the fight against crime Providing security and freedom for all citizens is the most important of all state tasks. The challenges in the fight against criminality are growing. Burglaries, thefts, robberies, threats, vandalism, acts of violence and a high level of foreign crime threaten the security of the individual. Especially the weaker members of our society are powerless in the face of increasing violence and inconsideration. Many women and older people are afraid to go out in the evening and at night. At the same time, the crime-solving rate is low. The risk of being held accountable for a crime is constantly decreasing. No wonder, the number of serious crimes is increasing. More than 900 crimes are now committed per day! Of particular concern is the growing number of intentional bodily injuries, which has doubled in the last ten years. Foreigner crime in concrete terms ""In September 2005, 81 percent of Switzerland's total of 6111 prison places were occupied by foreigners.""  (Federal Statistical Office) Ensuring security despite open borders With the dismantling of border controls as part of the implementation of the Schengen Treaty, the problem of criminality will become even more acute. Criminals will be able to pursue their schemes unhindered anywhere in the EU. Already today, the cantons complain about too few police officers in the fight against crime. To ensure security, a reallocation of personnel and, if necessary, an increase in the number of police officers is unavoidable. This means that the police have to devote themselves primarily to security tasks and not to fis-cal measures such as handing out budgeted fines to parking offenders. International crime ""The merging Europe opens up new opportunities for criminal organizations, and the EU, with its more easily crossed eastern borders, may become an obvious target for all larger criminal organizations.""  (Federal Police Security Report, 2004, p. 12) Tighten the penal system and apply the law swiftly and consistently If a criminal is convicted, the process takes a very long time. The sentences are often so lenient that there is no longer any question of deterrence. What is needed, therefore, is not only a targeted police presence and rapid intervention, but also a judiciary worthy of the name. The judicial authorities are called upon to pronounce law in the sense of the legislator and in the interest of the general public. In addition, instances for rapid decisions are to be introduced. Offenders who pose a public danger - especially sex offenders and violent criminals - must be detained by the courts for an indefinite period in order to protect the public. In addition to preparing for re-entry into our society, the penal system serves primarily as a means of atonement, deterrence and protection of society. A prison must not be a hotel where the individual wishes of each inmate are obligingly taken into account. Today's standard is clearly too high and too expensive. It has little deterrent effect, especially for crime tourists. On the contrary: Due to the fact that a salary can be earned in Swiss prisons, our penal institutions even seem attractive to some delinquents! No wonder, the vast majority of the prisoners are foreigners. The creation of opportunities for foreign prisoners to serve their sentences abroad must therefore be implemented quickly. In addition, the standard in prisons must be adjusted downward. Criminals must be consistently deported after serving their prison sentences. Countering juvenile delinquency Juvenile delinquency is on the rise, as evidenced in particular by escalations of violence at school, but also in sports arenas and in urban areas. Currently, we count up to 3 assault crimes per day by juveniles in Switzerland. This is due in part to the laissez-faire policies of recent years and lax immigration policies. Education and discipline were long frowned upon, but open borders for all were in. This development must be resolutely counteracted. This is a challenge for everyone: Parents, teachers and clubs. However, the state must also take a tougher stance. The parents are to be held accountable. As far as possible, the beginnings are to be resisted. Thus, offenses committed by students are to be punished with work assignments. Violent youth shall be housed and educated in separate facilities. Incorrigible criminal foreign youths are to be expelled from the country with their parents. Leftist chaos at work: Such scenes should not become an everyday occurrence in our country! Restore law and order in cities Cities and agglomerations suffer particularly from the increase in violent crime and vandalism. Major events increasingly have to be accompanied by larger police forces. The longer, the more an exit in the city can only be envisaged in a group. Public facilities are regularly destroyed and have to be restored at great financial expense. Often, the simplest means left is surveillance by cameras. The goal must be to restore order in the cities. Here, too, the necessary police forces must be made available. It cannot make sense to punish parking offenders but leave acts of vandalism taking place in the immediate vicinity unnoticed. The focus of the police has to be on fighting criminality and vandalism. Use common sense Despite all efforts, there is still no comprehensive security, because such a security would also stifle freedom. For a state as well as for individuals, freedom always entails a certain degree of risk. Security and personal freedom cannot always be fully reconciled, but security measures can be designed to maintain proportionality. The personal freedom and privacy of persons without a criminal record must be guaranteed, and any attempt to create a ""snooping state"" must be avoided. If we Swiss have a choice between freedom and security, we must continue to choose freedom in the future - this is what more than 700 years of history stand for. However, in order to ensure both safety and freedom in the future, judges are also called upon. If the range of punishment is not used appropriately for the case, the legislator is forced to formulate the law more strictly and thus also to limit the scope more. Or there is a lack of acceptance of the verdicts when minor traffic offenses are punished more massively than bodily injury offenses. Therefore, in the interest of all citizens, a sense of proportion and common sense is required for every judgment. The voice of freedom ""He who seeks security and sacrifices liberty for it deserves neither.""  (Benjamin Franklin, 1706-1770, American politician and writer) Viewpoints The SVP Calls for a more targeted police presence, tougher justice and a penal system that increasingly serves as a deterrent again; calls for the introduction of fast-track judges; calls for judges to use the sentencing range appropriately for each case; welcomes the creation of opportunities for foreign offenders to serve their prison sentences abroad; advocates the life-long detention of untreatable, extremely dangerous sexual and violent criminals; demands that the rights of victims take precedence over the rights of criminals; demands that security measures take into account proportionality and the civil liberties of citizens. National defense:  Threat-oriented militia army The state bears the responsibility for protecting its own population from foreign violence. He thus faces new challenges today. The ""new wars"" are increasingly denationalized, commercial and asymmetric, i.e. more and more often a state with its regular armed forces is confronted with autonomously operating combatants. The new form of global conflict is called terrorism. Terrorists are not simply people who run amok, but targeted fighters in the service of an ideology or a religion. The old distinction between war and peace, soldier and civilian, friend and foe, soldier and criminal, inside and outside, is becoming increasingly blurred. We observe civil wars, terror and anti-terror wars, wars of intervention; all with their own causes, actors, processes, strategies, winners and losers. Always full of suffering, death and destruction. But taking sides here weakens us in the fight against terrorism. Because anyone who allows himself to be drawn into a conflict also becomes a target. What do we have to defend? Even in times of security policy upheaval, what is at stake is our independence, our individual responsibility in direct democracy, our freedom, as well as the everlasting, integral and armed neutrality as a survival strategy of the small state. It is about the protection of life and limb, about the primacy of law in dispute resolution, and about the orderly functioning of society and the economy. Instrument of resistance ""The impulse that has animated the military in Switzerland for centuries is not the will to power, but the will to resist power.""  (Prof. Dr. Karl Schmid: Versuch über die schweizerische Nationalität, 1957) Do not shift responsibility We sense the claim to power of large states and inter-national organizations in the struggle for a new global world order. In our country, too, we are witnessing various attempts to undermine the nation-state's monopoly on the use of force and to shift political responsibility to opaque supranational bureaucracies. The constitutional principle of perpetual, integral and armed neutrality is increasingly becoming a plaything of inventive interpreters. The little guy on the big guy's skirt hopes in vain for a gain in security. Because the big one drags him along in his adventures. The desire for collective security is usually an expression of weakness, a way to avoid having to take individual responsibility. Our feeder services to NATO - in the form of the so-called ""Partnership for Peace"" - are therefore prob-lematic. Countering new forms of threat Despite new forms of threat, our Armed Forces continue to serve to prevent war and contribute to the preservation of peace. The army defends our country and its people. Rejecting the sovereign defense of our country is therefore not a solution. Rather, we need a sober and realistic new threat awareness adapted to strategic change. We need to learn about and protect today's vulnerabilities in the modern, tightly networked society. It is important to avoid creating vulnerable centers at the planning stage. What is needed is concentration on the essentials, decentralization, delegation of responsibility downwards, the ability to act in crises, and maximum flexibility. The crisis task force adopted by the Federal Council to rehearse and manage catastrophic situations is a step in the right direction. Troop deployment in the Mattenquartier Bern, severe weather 2005. Strengthen militia as a proven solution In Switzerland, the strategy of a militia army is deeply rooted, which does not wait in barracks for its missions, but is integrated into society and the economy and provides protection when it is needed. This also includes keeping the service weapon in the house, a proven expression of readiness for military service and the traditionally responsible handling of weapons by Swiss army personnel. The new forms of threat call for security missions which, in view of scarce finances, can only be met with a militia army. The ultimate responsibility lies with the sovereign, the citizen. This protection cannot be had without personal sacrifice. However, the militia, along with the perpetual, integrated and armed neutrality, constitutes a high threshold against military adventures of government and administration, against the non-acceptance of violence and war. The militia offers good professional, technical and human quality at all levels. For this reason, the militia must be adequately represented at all levels. Wherever violence is used, clear management responsibility is necessary. Everyone must know his mission, competences and means. We need a well-prepared state leadership that is capable of deploying the armed forces in the event of an emergency and that can deploy all the necessary services in combination and at the appropriate level. The mission of the army ""Today, the Army must retain the know-how for war and be able to defend the country below the threshold of war: Area security, object protection, disaster relief, airspace surveillance.""  (Federal Councillor Samuel Schmid, ""Facts"", 19.1. 2006) Ensure primacy of national defense The army reforms of recent years have not contributed to the population's confidence in national defense. The armed forces must now concentrate on implementing Ar-mee XXI without compromise, consolidating it and, in particular, eliminating the weak points of the reforms. Further measures should only be taken if they meet an objective or urgent need. International training cooperation and armed foreign missions should not be expanded further. For the SVP, national defense while preserving neutrality, the militia principle and general conscription remains the top priority. The armed forces must be optimally equipped and enabled with realistic exercises to fulfill the defense mission and all protection missions for the benefit of the population at all times. The army is not an auxiliary police force, but it must effectively support the civilian authorities in the event of acute and serious threats such as major disasters in order to protect the country and the population. Viewpoints The SVP regards integral, perpetual and armed neutrality as the most effective instrument against international terrorism; advocates a modern, efficient and credible militia army; calls for training suitable for the militia, appropriate representation of the militia in as many command functions as possible and an optimal capacity to grow; demands national defense as the primary mission of the armed forces; rejects Switzerland's accession to military alliances such as NATO; advocates subsidiary missions in the event of natural disasters, primarily at home; fundamentally rejects foreign deployments of the Swiss Armed Forces. Similarly, no compulsory refresher courses may be held abroad; calls for a liberal weapons law that does not hinder off-duty shooting and allows the storage of the ordnance weapon at home even after completion of official duty. Asylum policy: successes thanks to consistent action The vast majority of people seeking asylum in Switzerland are not refugees. They are not endangered in life and limb, but hope for a better standard of living here. Many live on social welfare, and some are involved in lucrative smuggling and drug trafficking. If the number of provisionally admitted persons is added to the number of recognized refugees, the total is only around 24 percent of all asylum decisions. Thus, more than 75 percent of all asylum applications are unfounded or even abusive. This must not be possible in the future. It is a main goal of the SVP and the responsible SVP Federal Council to reduce the number of applicants without real reasons for asylum. Remarkable successes have been achieved here: The number of asylum applications has fallen continuously. For the first time in asylum history, Switzerland is thus pursuing a more successful deterrence policy against the abuse of asylum law than its European neighbors. The measures taken, in particular the greatly shortened procedures and the freeze on social assistance for persons with a no-entry decision, are having an effect. Fix enforcement problems The biggest problems are still in enforcement. Many rejected asylum seekers (as well as other illegal residents) do not leave the country. Most asylum seekers do not disclose their identity and do not present identification documents. If the country of origin cannot be proven of identity, that country is not obligated to take back a rejected asylum seeker. When abuse is promoted, defended or even encouraged by institutions, politics is called upon. With the new asylum law presented by Blocher's department and approved by a two-thirds majority at the ballot box, there is justified hope that asylum numbers will continue to decline, costs will fall and abuse can be combated. Who is the stupid one in the asylum system? ""Stupid are not those who exploit this system, but those who make this system available"".  (Federal Councilor Christoph Blocher, Albisgüetli Conference, 20.1 . 2006) Integrating recognized refugees Recognized refugees and temporarily admitted persons, the vast majority of whom remain in Switzerland, are poorly integrated. Their labor force participation rate is far too low. For example, only 34 percent of provisionally admitted refugees who are capable of working are working, and only 24.2 percent of recognized refugees are working. The integration efforts have missed their target. This is mainly because the incentives for independence from state benefits are insufficient. Social assistance is often higher than the wage paid for gainful employment. Thus, there is little reason to accept a job. Little incentive for gainful employment A family of four with recognized refugee status not only receives an apartment and health insurance premiums for the entire family, but also several thousand francs a month without having to do any work. So why should a parent toil for a far lower wage as a salesperson, laborer, or service worker? Eliminate nuisance recourse route It is true that the duration of the asylum application procedure has generally been considerably shortened. But the overall duration of the procedures is still too long. In particular, the appeal process too often drags on for months and even years. The Re-kursinstanz likes to take its time with its pending matters, citing its autonomy and independence. In addition, it repeatedly makes decisions that disregard the welfare and security of the Swiss population. Thus, criminals and violent persons are also granted residence. One problem is still the ""asylum industry"", which with its numerous social workers, aid workers and asylum lawyers lives from the grievances and high numbers of applicants and therefore shows little interest in solutions. If we break down the total cost of asylum to the actual number of people recognized, one genuine refugee costs one million. Is this still humanitarian, reasonable or intelligent? In order to counteract this, the procedures must be massively streamlined and as many decisions as possible must already be made in the reception centers. In addition, criminal asylum seekers must be expelled. The Roma family from Rüschlikon For two years, the Asylum Appeals Commission delayed the decision on the well-known Roma family from Kosovo, which has been living in Switzerland since 1997 in the asylum procedure and lives in a beautiful house in the countryside. The father is in prison for domestic violence. The son seriously injured a man with a knife. One daughter became known as the 'youngest perpetrator of violence in Switzerland'. So far, this social nonsense has cost taxpayers far more than a million. Viewpoints The SVP calls for a consistent crackdown on abuses and maladministration in the asylum system; supports all measures to eliminate enforcement problems in the asylum system; advocates the abolition of emergency aid for rejected, unruly asylum seekers; calls for a short procedure that keeps the interests of the local population in mind. Will we soon be strangers in our own country? Foreigners' policy: putting the brakes on immigration The claim that Switzerland is closed off, isolated from other countries and a desert island in the middle of Europe belongs to the realm of modern fairy tales. The fact is that 100,000 people immigrate to our country every year, almost half of them as family reunification. Hardly any other industrialized country in the world has such a high level of immigration in relation to its population. With more than 20 percent, Switzerland has one of the highest proportions of foreigners in the world - with a very high naturalization rate per capita. This does not even include asylum seekers and temporarily admitted persons. The SVP is the only party to have warned that Switzerland is reaching the limits of its ability and willingness to integrate with this lax immigration policy. This has nothing to do with ""xenophobia"" or ""isolationist"" policies, but with genuine concern for the stability of society. Only recently have the other civic parties come to the conclusion that the SVP is right. The left, however, is still clinging to its multicultural vision, even though it has long since failed. Prevent mass immigration Unfortunately, Switzerland has increasingly lost control over the quality of immigration through international treaties. The abandonment of the status of seasonal migrants proved to be a serious mistake, because today family reunification accounts for more than 40 percent of immigration. The claim that immigration alone will continue to guarantee growth and secure social security systems is highly questionable based on the experience of comparable countries. In the Netherlands, it was found that the average immigrant costs the state more than he brings it. For Germany, the renowned Munich-based Ifo Institute has calculated that an average immigrant would have to live in the country for more than 25 years to give the state more than he or she receives. The fact is, however, that 80 percent return to the Hei-mat earlier or die. Accordingly, the welfare state can only be saved if either free immigration or the principle of immediate access to all social benefits is restricted. A Nobel Laureate on Mass Immigration ""Free immigration becomes questionable when it gives immigrants access to a 'national wealth' that has been built up over decades, even centuries, as well as to social benefits of all kinds.""  (Nobel Prize winner Gary Becker, ""Neue Zürcher Zeitung"", 8.7. 2004) Stop immigration to the social system Switzerland is still regarded as a country with a high level of integration capacity and willingness to integrate. But this willingness is being exploited, and the growing resentment of the population against borderless immigration has its reasons. The labor force participation rate of new immigrants has fallen dramatically compared to that of previous generations. Since 1990, the proportion of immigrants in the labor force has fallen from 53 percent to 38 percent. We are seeing increased immigration to the welfare system instead of the labor market - a consequence of our expanded welfare state. Free immigration can only function in a free market economy. It puts a strain on coexistence when immigrants end up disproportionately in unemployment (almost 40 percent), in crime (54 percent), in disability (over 40 percent of IV benefits), in the health system, in special educational services or in welfare. Foreigners are three times more likely to receive social assistance than Swiss citizens. Those who do not follow the rules must leave Conditions do not yet prevail as in the French or English suburbs. Nevertheless, we must be careful that parallel societies do not emerge in our country that have little contact with the Swiss social order and reject our liberal way of thinking. If you want to live in Switzerland, you have to abide by the applicable rules or leave the country. The problem of the approximately 100,000 illegally present persons - often trivially referred to as ""sans papiers"" - must not be ""solved"" by simply legalizing them. Instead, illegal immigration must be tackled consistently. Likewise, action must be taken against the undermining of our state by the creeping introduction of foreign law. Thus, the judges are called upon to pronounce law on the basis of our Christian occidental fundamental values and not to tolerate practices that contradict these fundamental values (female circumcision, proxy marriage, ""honor killings,"" ""polygamy,"" discrimination against women). Swiss law must be applied in Switzerland. Naturalization as the last step of integration For the SVP, naturalization is the last, not the first step of integration. Swiss citizenship includes - unique in the world - direct co-determination at federal, cantonal and municipal level, including on substantive proposals. This requires a high degree of integration, understanding of our political conditions and a good knowledge of at least one national language. The naturalization decisions of municipal assemblies and commissions must be accepted. The SVP opposes the automatic nature of naturalization and the right to appeal to the courts, and rejects voting rights for foreigners. Viewpoints The SVP Calls for a policy on foreigners that is oriented towards the needs of Switzerland; advocates the strict enforcement of Swiss laws, fundamental values and rules; calls for a mandatory, formal declaration of loyalty to the Federal Constitution and the legal order of the Swiss Confederation by every person applying for naturalization; rejects the general legalization of illegal residents and calls for strict action against illegal immigration; rejects the introduction of voting rights for foreigners; maintains that integration is not a matter for the state, but for foreigners; high demands must be placed on integration; demands that only those who undertake not to draw social welfare for at least 3 years be allowed to immigrate to Switzerland; demands that only those who have previously obtained a residence permit may be naturalized; defends the right of citizens to decide democratically on naturalizations and rejects any automatism in this area; demands that, as a matter of principle, those who receive an IV pension, unemployment benefit or social assistance may not be naturalized; demands that foreign criminals who have committed serious or violent crimes be expelled from the country; demands the creation of a legal basis so that in the case of serious or violent crimes, offenders who have been naturalized in the past 5 years can be deprived of their Swiss citizenship. Agriculture: The farmer is an entrepreneur The Federal Constitution and the Agriculture Act assign significant tasks to the farming community. Farmers should prevent the landscape from becoming gilded and remote areas from becoming depopulated. Farmers must ensure a minimum level of self-sufficiency in high-quality, healthy products. However, they fulfill these tasks under increasingly difficult conditions. The Swiss farming community is threatened from two sides: The leftists are agitating against farmers because they allegedly produce too expensively and vote too conservatively. The extreme libera-lizers, on the other hand, want to leave the farmers entirely to the free market, forgetting that they take on tasks that have nothing to do with the market: They protect the landscape and ensure decentralized settlement. And who will feed the population in an emergency? A federal office? The SBB? The trade union federation? Or rather the Swiss farmers? On the cost of agriculture ""Public transport now costs us 7.6 billion a year.  Twice as much as the whole agriculture.  These huge areas in the Alps, the Jura, the Central Plateau are preserved for half the amount of the railroad deficits!""  (Federal Councilor Christoph Blocher, Rencontres nationales, Montreux, 11.11.2005) Agriculture in the overall economy Even though agriculture has a few peculiarities, it is also an important part of the economy. It is of great economic importance, especially in rural areas. In Switzerland, around 250,000 people are employed in agriculture itself and in the businesses upstream and downstream of it; in addition, there are around 150,000 men and women who work in the wholesale and retail trade in agricultural products. Agriculture also fulfills an important function for tourism, which is also an important pillar of the Swiss economy. Freeing from the regulatory corset Food production is the responsibility of the farmers. So they should decide what to produce, how to produce and how much to produce. There is no need here for sprawling agricultural bureaucratic controls. The increasing paternalism and coercion of farmers with a flood of formulas and papers must come to an end. In production, each farmer should bear his own entrepreneurial risk and align himself with the needs of consumers. In principle, the market should pay for the services provided and decide on success or failure. The basis for this is a spatial planning law that provides farmers with the necessary entrepreneurial leeway. Compensation for services is not a subsidy The farmers cannot guarantee the protection of the habitat and the decentralized occupation of the land at normal market conditions. That is why the state compensates farmers with direct payments. These are not subsidies, but compensation for services rendered. They are aligned, whether the farmer owns a large or small farm, whether he farms full-time or part-time, whether he is poor or rich. Competition needs a level playing field ""Due to the drastic reduction of border protection, domestic producer prices and thus the incomes of farm families are coming under increasing pressure.  We farmers want to become more competitive. However, this is only possible to a limited extent, because we work in an expensive cost environment, with difficult topographical and climatic conditions and with restrictive regulations.  We also have to fulfill a constitutional mandate approved by the people.  In order to fulfill this mandate, we have to fight against an excessive opening of the borders, which endangers the existence of farming families.  (National Councilor Hansjörg Walter, WTO Media Conference, Geneva, 28. 6. 2006) Billions lost due to WTO The situation for future agriculture is coming to a dramatic head: in the worst case scenario, the WTO will impose a tariff reduction of three billion. In concrete terms, this would mean three billion less for agriculture, which corresponds to the total earnings of Swiss farmers. With a gross profit of ten billion euros, this would result in a shortfall of around 30 percent. The peasantry cannot survive like this. Therefore, a new agricultural policy must now be designed for the future that allows farmers to survive and Switzerland to ensure the preservation of the countryside and the supply of healthy food for the population. Beyond supply and demand It is all too often forgotten that multifunctional agriculture will continue to provide our country with services that cannot be measured in francs and centimes, over and above food production and the safeguarding of decentralized settlement. They form an important basis for a stable society, for intact family structures, for our cultural heritage, for a healthy work attitude. Efficient, hardworking and self-reliant farming families are the backbone of our country. Many part-time farmers are an important pillar in numerous trades and enterprises. Viewpoints The SVP demands an agricultural policy that enables the survival of farmers in the interest of a secure supply of domestic products for our population; advocates more entrepreneurial freedom for our producing farmers through fewer requirements and fewer fees, charges and taxes; demands a liberal spatial planning law; demands performance-based direct payments as compensation for the constitutional mandate of farmers to maintain the countryside and to provide sufficient supplies for the population. Agriculture makes a significant contribution to maintaining the beauty of our country. Education: Demanding Performance - Encouraging Performance The responsibility for education is shared between the federal government and the cantons. This cooperation should be strengthened, but centralization should be rejected. Reforms alone do not make a better school. The elementary school in particular needs to come to rest so that teachers can return to their real work of imparting knowledge and skills. Discipline, diligence and performance form the foundation of every successful education. The comfortable, performance-denying pedagogy of the left-wing '68 generation has failed with serious consequences. A pedagogy - whether at school or at home - that consists only of a cozy atmosphere and a sense of well-being and avoids any measurable achievement cheats children of other, equally important qualities: Will to persevere, sense of responsibility, willingness to perform, goal orientation. High standards in education are needed again. Money alone does not make good schools. This is shown by a comparison with other countries and their results. Quality depends less on the use of public funds than on the will to excel. Elementary school: more competence teaching instead of reformitis All too many school leavers show glaring weaknesses in language skills, especially spelling. Some school leavers have difficulty understanding a simple text at all. There are also alarming gaps in mathematics and science. Yet such basic skills are among the self-evident and obligatory goals in education. Instead of constantly experimenting with reforms, schools should once again teach students the basic core competencies. Where necessary, foreign language students are to be taught separately so that the performance and quality of the regular classes does not suffer. This tuition is to be co-funded by the parents. Students must perform in a clearly defined manner and are to be measured by their results. Lack of discipline, violence, cigarettes, alcohol and drugs should not be tolerated in schools. A wise word ""High learning can be demonstrated by knowing how to explain the most complicated things in a simple way.""  (George Bernard Shaw, 1856-1956, playwright, author and Nobel Prize winner) Vocational training: preserve the dual system The combination of in-company apprenticeship and public vocational school (dual system) has proven itself and is superior to foreign models of vocational training. Companies that train apprentices are to receive tax relief. The SVP rejects the weakening of this system by introducing state-run apprenticeship workshops. Instead, vocational training should be upgraded and graduates of higher vocational training and higher professional examinations should be granted appropriate access to universities of applied sciences. Improve conditions for apprenticeships and apprentices Training apprentices has become unattractive in recent years. Increasingly complicated requirements, a schooling of the apprenticeship and higher costs make the apprenticeship training unattractive, especially for smaller companies. At the same time, the level of education in elementary school has dropped to such an extent that school leavers often no longer meet the requirements of the training companies. The competitive pressure from foreign companies entering the Swiss market and offering lower prices than Swiss companies investing in young talent makes the situation even more difficult. An acute shortage of apprenticeships is the result. With an increase in the level of education and administrative and tax relief for those companies that train apprentices, this trend can be reversed. High schools and universities: higher requirements necessary Higher education in high schools and universities has to bear the consequences of the politics of '68. The level of the gymnasium baccalaureate has dropped, and the natural sciences have been massively devalued. There is already a shortage of young talent in the economy, and high schools and universities will soon no longer be able to keep up internationally. The SVP is calling for higher demands to be placed on grammar school pupils and students again and for the time spent at grammar school to be shortened. In particular, the mathematical-scientific subjects are to be strengthened. The Gymnasium is intended to provide a comprehensive general education and thus preserve and strengthen the humanistic tradition of the Occident. More autonomy and market economy at universities The SVP supports the ETH and the universities in their efforts to become more autonomous and market-oriented. These educational institutions must emphasize the teaching of theoretical competence, scientific work, and cutting-edge research. Study programs should be increasingly geared to the requirements of the market. Students who are not educated to meet the needs of the economy do not create value, but on the contrary inflate the social and welfare state. Education is a valuable personal asset that thrives best on a self-reliant basis. New loan systems can promote more responsible use of personal and financial resources in education. Targeted research Existing research funds should be increasingly concentrated on growth-relevant areas that add value and strengthen Switzerland's international competitiveness. Targeted, manageable domestic research projects should be given preference in government-funded projects. At the same time, however, the framework conditions for privately funded research must be improved. In order to support the cooperation between companies and universities, tax deductions for capital invested in research and education should be provided. Innovation is encouraged when researchers can share in the financial success of their research. Viewpoints The SVP Calls for the separate teaching of foreign-language children where necessary; this teaching is to be co-financed by parents; calls for an increase in the educational level of elementary schools through stricter curricula and performance and behavioral assessments in the form of grades; advocates that vocational training not be neglected in favor of high school education; supports the promotion of apprenticeships through administrative and tax relief for those companies that train apprentices; wants the universities of applied sciences to be able to award practical and internationally recognized degrees; calls for an increased concentration of university offerings in the interest of quality and efficiency; calls for the primary use of research funds in the country. AHV, IV, ALV: For secure social security systems If a majority is to continue to support the welfare state, it must be narrowly defined. Those who really need help should get help. But the honest worker and taxpayer should not have to pay for bogus invalids and workshy people. It must not be the case that fewer and fewer citizens work, pay social security contributions and taxes and get the feeling that they are the stupid ones in our society. In 1950 - shortly after the introduction of the AHV - social expenditures in Switzerland still amounted to 1.6 billion. By 1990 - before the introduction of the new Health Insurance Act - expenditures had increased to 64.5 billion. The dam then burst: in 2003, costs doubled to a good 129 billion. This means that, measured in terms of economic output (gross domestic product), the social expenditure ratio has increased from 19.3 (1990) to 29.9 (2003). There is a lack of coordination of benefits between the individual social insurance schemes. The result is expensive overinsurance. The opposite of ""social cuts Anyone who speaks of ""social cuts"" in the face of such figures has lost all touch with reality. Today, almost every third franc generated flows into the social and welfare state. Continued expansion is unrealistic, is gradually outstripping our economic capacity, and comes at the expense of future generations. This calls into question the welfare state as a whole. The leftists and their fellow travelers are acting irresponsibly when they pretend to provide total care to the citizens at zero cost. For this can only be financed by constantly higher compulsory levies and new debts running into billions. Secure retirement pension The AHV is facing considerable financing problems due to demographic developments. Without changes to the current legislation, the AHV fund will run out of money by the end of 2012. That is why the SVP is committed to ensuring that AHV pensions remain secure in the future. A retirement age of 65 is to be introduced for men and women from 2009. The introduction of an unaffordable bridging pension, which would create the wrong incentives, should be abandoned. In a second step, a comprehensive AHV revision must be carried out quickly in 2008, which includes flexible solutions based on the insurance principle. In addition, the federal share of the surplus gold reserves must benefit the AHV. Need for action on unemployment insurance Unemployment insurance (UI) is strongly dependent on the respective economic situation. The funding situation is critical today. From 2003 to 2005, the ALV generated a deficit of around 5 billion. The extension of the free movement of persons will place an additional burden on the unemployment insurance scheme. In order to safeguard unemployment insurance in the longer term and to reduce incentives for abuse, it is necessary to bring it into line with the OECD level. Similarly, the abusive extension of the reference period by the cantons must be prevented. The measures for integration into the labor market must be checked for their effectiveness. The regional employment centers (RAV) are also called upon in this regard. The cost-benefit ratio of these elaborately established centers has not been satisfactory to date. The problem of workshy people In cities, the number of welfare dependents is increasing by double-digit percentages. Our welfare state is reaching its limits. This is not least due to immigration to the social system. Numerous eighteen- to twenty-five-year-olds are taken directly from welfare after school and training. More and more high school students are not deterred by a future as a ""welfare recipient."" Those who become accustomed to the welfare state at such a young age will be a burden on the general public for decades. But the vast working majority has a right to protection from this growing entitlement mentality. It must not be the case that working people have to finance every failed life plan or even a wrong migration policy. Aid workers define poverty If - as the leftists and some representatives of aid organizations do - one million people of our population are basically declared ""poor"", there will always be poor people. A whole range of interest groups have now dedicated themselves to redistribution, creating more and more needy people by questionable standards. This legitimizes claims that undermine our social fabric and overstretch solidarity. The welfare state must provide genuine assistance to those who really need it. And it has been run down when it no longer distinguishes between the needy and the profiteers. A left-wing voice on disability insurance ""It is not an abuse if someone cleverly exploits the system for himself. ""(Beatrice Breitenmoser, SP, then head of IV, ""Rundschau"" of SF DRS, 8.10. 2003). Putting an end to IV abuse by bogus invalids Disability insurance was created to reduce or eliminate disability with suitable, simple and appropriate integration measures and, if necessary, to compensate for the economic consequences of disability. Increasingly, however, this insurance is being abused by bogus invalids. As a result, the disability insurance scheme currently incurs debts of around 2 billion a year. For years, the SVP has been drawing attention to abuses in disability insurance. The fact that there is a growing number of ""bogus invalids"" is now accepted as fact. Nevertheless, expenditures for the IV are rising continuously: While they amounted to 4 billion per year in 1990, they are three times as much today. Whereas 164,000 people received an IV pension in 1990, today the figure is 270,000. One in five men aged 64 receives an IV pension. The increase in IV cases is particularly alarming among state employees. The largest increase is in cases with unclear findings such as back conditions or mental illness. If every personal ailment suddenly suffices as an entry point for a pension, one should not be surprised at this increase. The SVP is not demanding new billions for the reorganization of the IV, but a new definition of who is disabled and who is not. This includes a retroactive review of pensions already awarded. The 5th IV revision currently underway will not be enough to solve the problems. The SVP has therefore already called for a 6th IV revision. The model of the red Basel ""The typical new social welfare case is young, foreign and unemployed.""  (Rolf Maegli, SP, Head of Social Welfare Basel-Stadt, ""Basler Zeitung,"" 17. 4. 2003) New clinical pictures for entry into invalidity ""A variety of new medical conditions serve as a barely verifiable gateway to disability. Let me give you just a few examples: Social phobia, Internet addiction, elevated cholesterol levels, obesity, menopause, irritable bowel syndrome, sleep disorders, constipation, burnout syndrome, hyperactivity, heavy sweating, uprooting syndrome, psychosocial depression, tinnitus (whistling in the ear), vitamin deficiency.""  (Federal Councilor Christoph Blocher before the Zürcher Volkswirt- schaftliche Geselschaft, Oct. 25, 2004). Viewpoints The SVP calls for comprehensive coordination of benefits between the individual social insurance schemes to avoid overinsurance; demands to secure the AHV -retirement age of 65 for men and women; -The allocation of the federal share of Swiss National Bank gold to the AHV; -The adjustment of pensions paid abroad to local purchasing power; is in favor of a comprehensive IV revision to prevent abuse through -an adjustment of the benefits; -A reduction in the number of beneficiaries by combating fictitious invalidity; -The adjustment of pensions paid abroad to local purchasing power; -Incentives for employers to employ potential IV pensioners; calls for the restructuring of unemployment insurance -an extension of the minimum contribution period; -An adjustment of the duration and amount of benefits to the OECD level; -The prevention of the cantons extending the reference period; rejects the increasing definition of standards by auxiliary workers; In the area of social welfare, incentives must be created to make work pay (bonus-malus system). Healthcare:  Our healthcare system is sick Unfortunately, our health care system is currently just as sick as the people who have to make use of its services. In 1994, the SVP was the only party to fight the Health Insurance Act (KVG) and to draw attention to the impending explosion in premiums. In the referendum campaign, this objection was disputed with the claim that premiums would practically not increase. Since then, contrary to all Federal Council forecasts, they have risen continuously; by almost 70 percent since the introduction of the KVG in 1996! People hardly know how to raise the money for their health insurance every month. More than one-third of the population is now dependent on government premium subsidies. Although the premium reduction alleviates the pressure, it also conceals the cost explosion and thus prevents the urgently needed reforms. Such a health care system is no longer healthy. Due to an increasing number of new tasks in the catalog of services and a lack of willingness to save money on the part of almost everyone involved in the healthcare system, healthcare costs have risen at an alarming rate. Ruth Dreifuss (SP) on health insurance premiums ""I expect that the increase will be slowed down from 1998 and 1999.""  (""Tages-Anzeiger,"" Oct. 6, 1996) ""The cost trend is flattening out from year to year. (...) Our cost containment measures are taking better effect every year.""  (""Blick"", 7. 7. 2001) Recovery thanks to premium reduction initiative The Federal Council is experimenting in the health care system without a plan or concept. A revision of the health insurance law without clear objectives degenerates into a permanent construction site without tangible results. A KVG revision has failed, and the ongoing, poorly coordinated detailed revision at the level of laws and ordinances remains without effect. The SVP's premium reduction initiative is currently the only viable concept for preventing the cost explosion. It creates the constitutional provision necessary to enable a federal health policy focused on transparency. The goal is to make all services transparent with full cost accounting. Service providers and consumers should be given economic freedom without the insured having to forego a selectable, compulsorily insured and unconditionally accessible range of basic services. What belongs to the basic supply? Health care costs now exceed 50 billion a year. Premiums have become unaffordable for all too many. That is why the SVP demands a solid, efficient basic insurance and lower premiums. What is needed is a more trans-parent healthcare system with incentives for better cost awareness among insured persons, insurers, doctors, the pharmaceutical industry, therapists and hospitals. We face the uncomfortable question of what belongs in basic insurance and what does not. Where does basic medical care end and where does the wellness area begin, which is good for all of us, but whose costs do not have to be paid by the general public? The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as ""a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being"". Those who define health so broadly drive up costs to such an extent that ultimately the whole system collapses. That is why the SVP is calling for solid basic insurance with low premiums. Fight drugs Intoxicants are not stimulants, but substances that lead to addiction in a very short time and destroy body and mind. The aim of the SVP's drug policy is to combat drug trafficking, prevent people from starting to use drugs and lead addicts to freedom from addiction. The legalization of so-called ""soft drugs"" such as hashish or marijuana is strictly rejected. These plants are anything but harmless and today have a THC content that is far higher and therefore more dangerous than the original plants. The SVP also opposes government administration of drugs to addicts. This is because the distribution of heroin does not lead to the cure of drug addicts, but corresponds to a state-supported prolongation of drug addiction. Tough action is also needed against the sale and use of cocaine and so-called party drugs. Viewpoints The SVP is using a popular initiative to call for solid, streamlined basic insurance with low premiums; demands a transparent healthcare policy with full cost accounting; calls for efficient basic insurance with better incentives for cost awareness among all those involved in the healthcare system; is opposed to planned ""state medicine"" and instead fights for freedom of choice and competition in the healthcare system; is committed to good quality healthcare - especially in rural areas; rejects the legalization of all types of drugs. Traffic: Solve problems instead of displacing them Red-green traffic policy: traffic jam! Functioning transport is a prerequisite for a flourishing economy and for our prosperity. However, the Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC), under the leadership of Federal Councillor Leuenberger (SP), prefers to pursue a policy of prevention and increasing costs. With the ideological admonishing finger, motorists are admonished, discriminated against and finally asked to pay. The SVP opposes this policy and defends the free choice of transport. Mobility requires all modes of transport: roads, rail, water and air, both private and public No mode of transport should be discriminated against for ideological reasons. Transport policy on the loser's road Switzerland's transport policy has been one of the big losers in recent years: whether air traffic (flight safety, air traffic agreement with Germany, Swiss billion), road traffic (transit gifts to the EU, traffic jams, anti-growth agglomeration traffic) or rail traffic (billions of euros shortfall with the NRLA, unattractive freight traffic, annual deficits of billions for the railroads) - Federal Councillor Leuenberger has been highly unfortunate in all these dossiers. Rail transfer policy failed The railroad accounts already showed a deficit of 7.598 billion in 2002. The 650,000 trucks relocated by 2009, as promised by the Federal Council, are unlikely to be achieved. In the mid-eighties, a larger proportion of freight was transported by rail than today. Despite billions in investment, no real shift is evident. So the relocation policy has failed - and no one admits it. The Bilateral Agreements brought hundreds of thousands of EU trucks into our country - even though the Federal Council assured the voters that the agreements would not lead to an ""avalanche of trucks. For reasons of European policy, the EU's demands have largely been met. Switzerland originally charged 600 francs per transit trip. In the end, the Minister of Transport brought it to a paltry 325 francs. Thus, there can be no shift of freight traffic to rail. Equally disturbing is the fact that domestic shippers are subject to stricter technical requirements than those from the EU. The costs of large-scale rail projects are developing in a completely different way from what was presented at the time of the vote. The gap between promises and actual costs is widening. The Neat billion chaos In September 1992, the Swiss electorate said yes to the New European Alpine Transversal (Neat). But to which Neat? In the referendum campaign, Neat was supposed to cost around 10.8 billion - including loans for contingencies. Meanwhile, the estimate is already 24 billion. According to the risk analysis, the cost of the two axes could rise by billions more, and there is a threat of billion-dollar deficits in operating costs. In addition, it has become apparent that the loans from the federal government, which financed 25 percent of the investments, cannot be repaid as promised. The red felt in transport policy Federal Councillor Moritz Leuenberger (SP), Head of the Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC); DETEC Secretary General Hans Werder (SP); former SBB CEO Benedikt Weibel (SP); Cargo Director Daniel Nordmann (SP, psychologist and former trade unionist); SP Councillor of States Ernst Leuenberger (long-time President of the Railways). SBB CEO Benedikt Weibel (SP); Cargo Director Daniel Nordmann (SP, psychologist and former trade unionist); SP Councillor of States Ernst Leuenberger (long-standing President of the Railway Workers' Union and of the relevant Commission for Transport and Telecommunications); National Councillor Peter Vollmer (SP, Director of the Public Transport Association VöV). NEAT: not only a hole in the mountain, but also in the federal treasury. Problems with air traffic The SVP has vigorously fought the disastrous federal involvement in the airline Swiss from the very beginning. The warnings were thrown to the wind. The others spoke of rosy prospects, top capitalization and best prospects for coming alliances. But Swiss wrote losses of one and a half million every day. In the meantime, 2.5 billion of public funds have been destroyed. The company was dramatically reduced and lost its independence. Federal Councilor Leuen-berger's negotiations on an air traffic agreement with Germany turned out to be a debacle. A unilateral agreement was forced on us by Germany against the interests of the airport. The new approach regime discriminates against Switzerland and makes hundreds of thousands angry and sleepless. It is high time that new negotiations remedy this situation. The result of the policy of Federal Councilor Leuenberger (SP). Secure airport infrastructure Our airports are hubs of regional and international trade and tourism. The infrastructure of airports is an essential basis for our value creation and also deserves the necessary framework conditions. The technical development of aircraft necessitates constant further development of the infrastructure. But while the Federal Council is pulling out all the stops to expand the rail infrastructure, hardly any attention is being paid to the airports. The right of associations to complain is also proving to be an additional obstacle to development here, as is the cap on aircraft movements. Instead of obstructing the airports, they must be given the necessary space. The SVP also advocates that part of the fuel taxes that air traffic pays to the federal government should be returned to the airports for the maintenance of the infrastructure. Liquefaction instead of rip-off and prevention policy Of the total passenger traffic volume, private transport handles about 80 percent. In domestic freight traffic, the share of private commercial vehicle traffic is around 86 percent. Collective transport would never be able to satisfy the transport needs of our national economy. That is why the SVP fights against the increasing heresy and criminalization of citizens behind the wheel. The obvious rip-off through horrendous fines and lowering of the speed tolerance must not be accepted. Drivers already pay 7.6 billion in taxes, while roads only cost 6.8 billion. The aim of left-wing transport policy under the aegis of Federal Councillor Leuenberger is to impede traffic by means of congestion or road tolls (road pricing or mobility pricing) and thus to restrict the mobility of citizens and the economy. In doing so, the disadvantage of peripheral areas is deliberately accepted. Since the poorly negotiated land transport agreement came into force, Switzerland has been struggling with permanent congestion. The performance-based heavy goods vehicle tax LSVA has only benefited industry instead of shifting traffic onto the railways. The SVP calls for a liquefaction of traffic by investing in road infrastructures. Viewpoints The SVP supports the free choice of means of transport and rejects traffic-impeding chicanes such as mobility pricing or the capping of the number of air traffic movements; calls for the immediate completion of the decided parts of the national road network and for the elimination of bottlenecks to be tackled; opposes poorly planned, overpriced projects to shift traffic to the railways; demands a transparent, reliable cost estimate for large-scale rail projects and a second referendum on the FinöV costs and their financing; demands a reorganization of transit traffic, especially heavy goods traffic on the north-south axis; demands renegotiations with Germany on air traffic with the aim of returning to the old approach regime; advocates the development of airports for thebenefit of the economy and tourism; demands the expansion of the road network, especially in the conurbations. The new rip-off machines - bare chicanery for road users. Energy: Secure supply of cheap energy Switzerland's energy policy is at a crossroads. With the expiry of the electricity contracts with French nuclear power plant operators and the end of the operating lives of the Beznau I and II and Mühleberg NPPs, Switzerland will have a serious electricity supply problem from 2020 at the latest. Energy consumption is increasing rapidly not only in Switzerland, but worldwide. Measures must be taken to ensure that our country will continue to have a secure and affordable power supply in the future. The idea of a 2000-watt society is a utopia that will get us nowhere. It is not acceptable to forego a secure energy supply for our country and its population for ideological reasons. Even with increased energy efficiency and savings measures, it will not be possible to meet the energy demand in the future. The problem must be tackled immediately. Electricity from domestic production Switzerland is in the fortunate position of having extensive water resources. Swiss electricity production is based on the two main pillars of hydropower and nuclear power. These account for a good 95 percent of our energy supply. Even with strong subsidies, alternative energy sources will be able to cover a maximum of 10 percent of our energy needs in 2035 and will therefore not be able to replace the proven energy sources of water and nuclear power. The expansion of hydropower must be kept in mind. At the same time, however, the replacement of existing nuclear power plants with new, efficient nuclear power plants must be planned today. Sufficient supplies are available. The question of waste disposal, which is still open today, must be solved quickly and domestically. Cleaner energy - better environmental protection More efficient use of nuclear energy provides clean energy and can make a significant contribution to reducing the CO2 problem. Switzerland has achieved a high standard in the field of environmental protection. Numerous emission limits are stricter than the European limits. There is no need for further measures. However, if further positive effects can be achieved through the progress of science, for example through the more efficient use of nuclear energy, this is to be welcomed. Nuclear power is CO2 neutral. Biomass of growing importance Energy from biomass has the potential to become one of the most important alternative energy forms in the future, alongside hydropower. Its CO2 neutrality is of crucial importance, especially in view of Switzerland's ongoing commitments to the Kyoto Protocol. At the same time, it is one of the few renewable indigenous resources for energy production. Wood is by far the most important biomass resource in Switzerland. In addition, however, there are other ways to obtain energy from biomass. In this context, particular reference should be made to biomass produced specifically for energy generation, such as rapeseed or sugar. Both substances can be used to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Switzerland's electricity production Conventional thermal and other power plants 4.7% Run-of-river power plants Nuclear power plants 25.3 % 40.0 % 30.0 % Storage power plants (hydropower) in the fuel sector. The production of biomass also opens up new fields of activity for local agriculture and forestry. Favorable framework conditions for these sectors allow them to make an important contribution to domestic electricity and fuel production. Inexpensive energy instead of ideology bats Viewpoints The SVP advocates the continuation of nuclear energy as a safe, clean form of energy that ensures independence. This will help to combat global warming; supports the expansion of hydropower (especially pumped-storage power plants); welcomes the use of renewable, low-cost domestic energy such as biomass, as well as the establishment of framework conditions that allow these forms of energy to develop in the market; rejects initiatives that lead to new levies and redistribution actions. Media: Diversity instead of diversity The freedom of the media is of central importance in every democracy: television, radio and the press are crucial for the formation and dissemination of opinion. Unfortunately, the diversity of opinion in our country is in a bad way after the leftist '68 generation marched through the media landscape. For a long time now, reporting has no longer been well-founded and critical, but one-sided and monotonous. A few newspaper publishers always publish the same reports and commentaries under different titles. Monopolistic and coercively financed television and radio stations prevent genuine competition and diversity The state administration runs large in-house PR apparatuses to help it achieve its goals. A representative survey ""Together with Télévision Suisse Romande (TSR), 'Le Temps' commissioned an opinion research institute to investigate the professional reality of 200 representatively selected journalists from western and German-speaking Switzerland (...).  The proportion of voters for left-wing parties among journalists is, at 60 percent, twice as large as among the population as a whole.""  (""Der Bund"", 25.9. 2001) The poison of state propaganda The covert but purposeful influence of our government on opinion leaders in our country has led to an alignment of the press and the media. Our newspapers largely spread the same governmental left-liberal message; the only differences are in tone. Federal Berne no longer needs to reach out to the media, because it already has them largely in hand. An estimated 750 so-called communications consultants share 290 full-time positions in the federal administration. This is dangerous for our country, because democracy is the state form of alternatives: there can only be different opinions, not wrong or right ones. More competition for radio and television At most, the state should cover basic radio and television services. This must ensure a minimum of information, culture and entertainment. The supply of communications and media services to the peripheral regions must also be ensured. SRG collects its fees for these orders. However, ensuring basic care does not require a monopoly position. Specialized programs such as youth radio, jazz radio or folk radio are not part of the basic service. Here, competition should play a role, so that private providers have the same long stakes as the SRG. In addition, private broadcasters are to be given space, especially with fewer advertising bans. Moreover, the privatization of SRG must not be a taboo. For a diverse newspaper landscape As a result of an increasing concentration process, newspaper diversity is now just as threatened as diversity of opinion. Regional independent newspapers are becoming increasingly rare. A few dictate the opinion that the press has to represent. The SVP is committed to freedom of expression and freedom of the press that is worthy of the name. The most effective contribution to the preservation of a diverse newspaper landscape could be made by the federal government by consistently dispensing with its own PR agents, communications officers and glossy brochures. The more government and administration leave the discussion of public affairs to the media, the more attractive and diverse the reports and opinions become. For fair and professional journalism Good journalism should be fair, factual and professional. The motive of a good journalist must be to depict reality instead of helping his political point of view to break through and to denigrate people or parties he dislikes. Strangely enough, the factual reports on political and economic events differ more and more, while the opinion columns often resemble each other in every detail. In good journalism, it should actually be the other way around. The abuse of a national or regional monopoly position for campaign journalism must be condemned. It must not be the case that instead of a diverse and independent education, the corporations also exploit their power for the direct education and training of journalists. Viewpoints The SVP advocates diversity of opinion and offerings in the media landscape; demands an end to state propaganda by public relations officers of the administration; calls for substantial fee reductions for monopolistic radio and television as well as more advertising freedom for private providers; expects a media landscape with functioning competition, diverse offerings and independent journalist training. Culture: Culture is a matter of culture Culture is the human striving and creation for the realization of mental and spiritual values. It cannot be ""prescribed"" by the state, but at best it can be encouraged. The multilingualism and cultural diversity of the country have so far saved us from a ""state culture"" and corresponding support measures. For any ""state culture"" (including subordination to EU cultural dirigisme) endangers cultural freedom and diversity and leads to corruption-like mousehouses between politicians and cultural workers. Instead, private patronage should be specifically promoted and given tax advantages. In principle, culture is not a matter for the federal government, the cantons or the municipalities. Culture is primarily a matter of culture. Thus, state cultural policy can only have a complementary character. Against the subsidized center-left culture In the case of a nationally supported culture, there is a danger that the government will favor the culture that is politically close to it. Thus the Federal Council, which for years pursued a center-left course, also promoted a corresponding culture. With the help of state cultural foundations, certain expressions of culture and cultural criticism were selectively emphasized without a corresponding economic basis supported by demand. The problem with public funding is that by its very nature it is always selective and discriminatory against all those who are not funded. Folk culture is lived culture Folk culture receives hardly any state support. It thrives on the voluntary and enthusiastic commitment of individuals and of associations. Amateur theaters, singing societies, music formations, costume groups, and even Guggenmusik; they all strive less for abstract awards from international cultural critics than for what constitutes culture in its essence: the need to create something that gives pleasure. They all create real living culture, close to the needs of the audience. The more state support for culture grows, the more this living folk culture is lost. Government support can thus have a destructive effect where it does not provide support. Etatism or freedom? In cultural policy, and especially in film promotion, the question is whether the statist or the libertarian line will prevail. Questioning and cancelling funding should not be confused with ""censorship."" Cultural creation may and should also be critical of society and the state, because this is one of its important functions. Culture must not simply ""please"" and entertain, it should also stimulate and inspire reflection and empathy. There is as little to be said against an independent ""left-wing cultural scene"" as there is against a classical ""bourgeois"" opera, concert and theater culture or cultural events in the area of folk music and folklore. No cultural sector has a vested claim to state funding or can claim a fixed share of the ""cake"" of cultural funding. Nor should cultural policy serve to help one culture dominate or to counteract another. Supply and demand also in culture The more centralized and the more nationally driven cultural promotion is, the more questionable it becomes. Public cultural funding at the local and regional level is therefore less problematic because of the ""competition of sponsors"" and the multitude of political and tasteful shades. The SVP also wants to let the competition of ideas and the free-market law of supply and demand play out in cultural policy. The culture that pleases the public should be successful. Those who want to consume kitsch should be able to do so just as much as those who enjoy art performances at the limits of good taste as culture. However, this must not be financed with taxpayers' money and thus approved by the authorities. Viewpoints The SVP advocates a lively, free culture and fights against any kind of ""state culture""; wants to favor private patronage through taxation; advocates that cultural subsidies are not distributed in a way that discriminates against popular culture; fights against the state's favoritism of left-wing cultural creativity and the entangled subsidy structures. Sports: Sports stimulate body and mind Sensible sport serves the health of the individual as well as the whole nation. Meaningful sporting activity maintains physical and mental health and performance and promotes integration into the community. Sport is a life training for the youth, but also an ideal form of encounter for the whole society. The federal government plays a coordinating and supporting role The promotion of sport - with the exception of school and youth sport - should not, however, be primarily a matter for the state. Youth and popular sports start in the club In sports, self-confidence, but also frustration tolerance can be trained. Children and young people learn consideration and self-control, but also competitive spirit and healthy ambition. The tireless voluntary and often honorary work done in the associations is of great importance. In clubs and associations, young people learn at an early age to assume responsibility and even leadership functions. Sport means active leisure time and re-duces the risk of slipping into drug addiction. School sports offer a change of pace from everyday school life, while mass sports provide a balance to everyday working life. Sporting activity provides people with physical and mental well-being and maintains their ability to perform. Standing up for Switzerland together. Thousands of volunteers make it out ""The Swiss Federal Institute of Sport Magglingen offers various training courses in sport, (...) and we support top-level sport (...). Furthermore, it is the cantons, the federations and the clubs with thousands of volunteers that make up our sports movement.""  (Federal Councillor Samuel Schmid, ""Neue Zürcher Zeitung"", 24.12. 2005) Top sport motivates Popular sports form an important basis for top-level sports. Conversely, the top performances of top athletes motivate young people in particular to take up sports. Athletic talent is to be fostered through a training program that combines academic and vocational training with professional sports training. Major sporting events such as the 2008 European Football Championship have a unifying and motivating effect on the entire country and are also of considerable social and economic significance. However, the euphoria for such events is also increasingly being misused to obtain more federal funding for one project or another. Such desires are not to be yielded to. Success is guaranteed when the public is enthusiastic and the business community is involved in private sponsorship. Fair play instead of doping and violence Excesses at major events, as well as doping scandals in top-level sport, have to some extent damaged the positive reputation of sport in recent years. Time and again, it seems that the focus is no longer on fairness and honest competition, but on self-serving tricks, quick money and the law of the jungle. The SVP is in favor of a rigorous crackdown on doping offenders and on violence by hooligans in and around stadiums. Within the stadium, it is primarily the organizers who are called upon here. They generate high revenues from sporting events and in return have to make their contribution to safety. Outside the stadium and at international events such as Euro 08, however, the state must also fulfill its mandate to ensure security. On the other hand, any cross-subsidization of events via security budgets must be rejected. It is not acceptable, for example, to use loan applications under the guise of the security budget to divert additional financial resources for the coffers of the host cities. Viewpoints The SVP advocates physical education in schools and a talent-enhancing training program; attaches social and economic importance to top-level sport and major sporting events; advocates doping-free sport and calls for uncompromising action against hooligans and vandalism. People, family and community: Together instead of against each other Cooperation rather than antagonism between the generations is of great importance for the future. The cohesion of old and young is a prerequisite for the stability of our society. Loneliness, isolation and separation often make people unhappy, suffering and even sick. In the community with other people they find security, safety and happiness. Strengthen the traditional family Marriage and family continue to be the foundation and core of our community. Each couple is free to choose its family form, but also bears the responsibility for the consequences of the chosen path. Traditional families with their children deserve the special protection and recognition of the state and society. A significant contribution to society is made in these families. Parents are responsible for the education and development of their children. In the process, the child learns mutual help and consideration as well as the ability to deal with conflicts. The family provides security and care and mutual support throughout life. For children who have to grow up without the protection of the family, sufficient care places have to be offered. However, this is not a matter for the federal government, but for the cantons and municipalities, because they know the needs best. The aim is not to set up care services across the board, but to leave the initiative to the private sector as far as possible. The state must help where it is needed, but not impose a form of care. Carrying responsibility within the family is preferable to an attitude of entitlement toward the state. Family support primarily starts with taxes. The SVP therefore advocates tax relief in favor of the family. In doing so, it is important to relieve parents as well as people who care for their relatives. This strengthens personal responsibility and rewards those who take care of themselves and their families. Do not discriminate against single people Around half of Swiss households today are single-person households. Regardless of whether this way of life is freely chosen or determined by fate, the SVP believes that the state should neither discriminate against single people in society nor make them pay unduly. Rather, single people and single households also contribute to the community by helping to finance infrastructure for families, children, and education without benefiting di-rectly from it. They are also often good consumers and thus make an important contribution to our economy. The SVP opposes attempts to put additional strain on the solidarity that exists today among single people. Woman and man: partners in business and politics Woman and man are equal and equal partners. They should strive for a way of life and division of labor appropriate to their situation, in which both of them - and especially the children - do not miss out. The SVP stands for a policy in which women and men work together, not against each other. It is not who is a woman or a man, but who is best suited, who should hold office. Equal rights and equal pay for work of equal value for men and women are a matter of course for the SVP. However, a mania for equality through comprehensive bureaucratic regulations serves this goal just as little as a battle of the sexes. The SVP is therefore opposed to egalitarianism and is committed to the independent partnership of men and women in the family, in society, at work and in politics. Our youth - our future Young children need at least one permanent caregiver so that their later psychological stability is not endangered. State institutions such as crèches, lunch rooms, etc. cannot and should not replace parental love and care. The upbringing of children is the responsibility of their parents from birth to adulthood and cannot simply be delegated to the state. It is important for our young people to have support and recognition as well as good opportunities for development, training and continuing education. The family offers the ideal conditions for this. The SVP supports clubs and youth associations as important providers of a meaningful way of life and leisure. For an active ageing policy There are currently 1.2 million AHV recipients in our country. After their long working lives, the elderly have a right to adequate welfare and - if necessary - sufficient care. The older generation should be able to participate in social life as long as their mental and physical strength permits. Fewer and fewer working people are paying for the social security of more and more elderly people. Full attention must therefore be paid to safeguarding the pension provision achieved. The SVP is committed to ensuring that health insurers also provide adequate financial support for non-hospital care (home care). Old-age centers are to be built centrally in village or urban quarters, where the elderly have life around them and can also meet other people. ""The population must regain the conviction that the truly good work does not lie in socio-political nitpicking, but in the liberation to independent action"".  (Peter Ruch, Reformed pastor, ""Neue Zürcher Zeitung"", 10.1. 2006) ""The Church cannot and must not usurp the political struggle to realize the most just society possible. It cannot and must not put itself in the place of the state.""  (Pope Benedict XVI, Deus Caritas est, Encyclical Part II, ch. 28b) Church and state complement each other The SVP is committed to our Western Christian tradition. The churches are called upon to offer people support and real help in life through proclamation and pastoral care. The SVP fully supports the freedom of faith and conscience guaranteed to all Swiss citizens by the Federal Constitution. On the other hand, it resolutely opposes the expression of religious-political claims to power and their symbols (for example, the erection of minarets). In our country there is freedom of belief and conscience. It cannot be the business of a party or the state to tell people what to believe in matters of faith. Freedom of faith and conscience must also mean: Freedom for the service of preaching and for the activities of the churches within the framework of religious peace. But it must also not be the church's business to engage in politics. The SVP deeply regrets any one-sided, ideolo-gically influenced political statement made by church radio officials, because this undermines the pastoral care and proclamation mission of the churches. Viewpoints The SVP wants to support families through legal and tax relief; recognizes women and men as equals in work and politics; advocates an independent division of labor in the family. It therefore calls for the abolition of the Equality Office and other offices concerned with the state regulation of family life; considers child rearing to be a primary task of parents; calls for day structures to be set up only where there is a need and for financing to be provided primarily by private individuals; in clearly defined cases, cooperation between cantonal and local authorities and the private sector can take place; calls for the safeguarding of old-age provision; opposes any religious-political claim to power; calls for churches to devote themselves increasingly to pastoral care instead of day-to-day politics. Cathedral of St. Peter, Geneva. The way of the future: personal responsibility instead of socialism Switzerland still has an achievement-oriented, self-responsible middle class that does not call on the state every time it encounters a difficulty or effort. However, the creeping socialism has taken hold of our country somewhat belatedly, but all the more thoroughly. The 1990s marked the breaking of the dam and constituted an actual ""social-democratic decade"" with rampant government spending, mountains of debt, tax rates, fees and premiums. A left-wing redistributive elite has skillfully and successfully placed itself at the decisive levers of politics, society, media and culture, and is channeling state money into its own pockets and those of its clientele. Left re-education A veritable program of re-education has resulted in freedom, personal responsibility and entrepreneurial achievement suddenly appearing suspect. The duty of an employer concerned for the company and jobs, namely to make a profit, is increasingly being morally questioned. Yet capable entrepreneurs, craftsmen and tradesmen are the true ""social workers"" in our country. Social is not who diverts funds from one pocket to another or generously distributes the money of others. Truly social is the one who creates jobs or takes responsibility for himself and his own and does not become a burden to the general public. Farewell to the successful model? The Swiss model of success is based on a moderate state with a free, prospering economy. There is no reasonable reason to deviate from this. We have simply become unfaithful to ourselves in recent years The new member states of the EU have consistently relied on a liberal market economy since the collapse of socialism. Even social democratic-led states in Scandinavia have initiated liberal reform programs. Only Switzerland continues in the direction of socialism - protected by a majority left-wing dictated media. Nowhere in the world have the power of the authorities, state intervention and state regulation grown more strongly in recent years than in Switzerland. Our government share has grown faster than in all OECD countries. Return to the successful model! Instead of taking the well-known socialist wrong path into unemployment, debt and poverty, we should return to our liberal heritage: to hard work and personal responsibility, competition and open markets, free pricing and stable monetary policy, private property instead of redistribution, more freedom and less state. This is what the SVP stands for in our country. Anyone who wants to move our country forward therefore has only one choice: the SVP!"
43810,201110,"Those who vote for the Swiss People's Party should know where they stand. The SVP speaks plainly and steers a clear, reliable course. In the past, the representatives you elected to the federal, cantonal and municipal authorities offered guarantees that they would consistently implement their promises. That's exactly how they will keep it in the future and how they will be measured. The SVP is committed to for a secure future in freedom and prosperity , for a home worth living in our beautiful Switzerland; for the Swiss special case with its pillars of sovereignty, direct democracy, perpetual neutrality, federalism and subsidiarity; for limiting immigration so that our Switzerland remains worth living in and we do not have to feel like strangers in our own country; for the protection of private property and privacy; for a more economical national budget by reducing taxes, fees and charges for all; for more market and less bureaucracy, for secure jobs in our companies and businesses; for a foreign policy that is open to the world and self-confident without joining the EU, EEA or NATO; for tougher punishment instead of coddling of criminals and for the deportation of criminal foreigners. With the introduction of the free movement of persons and the opening of the borders, Switzerland has given up control over immigration. There is hardly a country in the world where so many foreigners live in relation to the native population as in Switzerland. The consequences for infrastructures, rents, land prices, spatial planning, energy consumption, schools, health care or social services are serious. Percentage of foreigners since 1950 Restore controllability Moderate immigration can make sense for a certain period of time and in a certain order of magnitude in order to recruit sufficient workers, especially for the economy. It is important that immigration remains controllable and can be reduced or stopped if necessary. This is no longer the case today. In the last four years, more than 330,000 more people officially immigrated to Switzerland than emigrated. If this trend continues in the longer term, the negative consequences will clearly outweigh any positive effects. Around 70% of immigration today comes from EU countries. It can no longer be influenced because of the free movement of persons. This situation is further aggravated by too easy family reunification from third countries, numerous illegal residents and once again rising asylum figures. To regain the ability to act, the free movement of persons with the EU and the Schengen Agreement must be reviewed and renegotiated. Illegal residents must be consistently turned away, and the asylum procedure must be accelerated. The facts: The consequences of the free movement of persons and open borders are becoming increasingly apparent. In the last four years, net migration, i.e. the difference between immigration and emigration, amounted to more than 1% of the total population, or, in absolute figures, to an average of more than 83,000 additional persons per year who, on balance, immigrated to Switzerland and live and work here as well as use social services and infrastructure. The annual increase corresponds roughly to the size of the city of St. Gallen. In just sixty years, the proportion of foreigners in Switzerland has almost quadrupled. Whereas the proportion of foreigners in 1950 was still 5.9%, by 2010 it had risen explosively to 22%. Tendency further increasing! None of our immediate neighbors has as high a proportion of foreigners as our country. The Federal Statistical Office has shown where this development will lead with its scenarios for population development in Switzerland. Depending on the scenario, there could be up to around 10 million people living in Switzerland in 2035. The SVP demands: Immigration must again be controlled and sensibly limited. The free movement of persons with the EU and the Schengen Agreement must be renegotiated. The negative effects of the free movement of persons and unrestrained immigration on rents, land prices, spatial planning and infrastructures, schools, unemployment and social services must be disclosed. Persons residing illegally in Switzerland and criminal foreigners are to be expelled. The asylum procedure must be accelerated. S I C E S S I T Y Tougher on criminals Safety is a key location factor. Every citizen has a right to security at home and on the road But today almost everyone knows someone in their circle of acquaintances who has been burgled or who has been the victim of a violent crime. The perpetrators are often foreigners. This is also borne out by the statistics: almost half of all crimes are committed by foreigners. The objective of Swiss foreign policy is laid down in Article 2 of the Federal Constitution: ""The Swiss Confederation shall protect the liberty and rights of the people and preserve the independence and security of the country"". EU accession is not compatible with these principles. Likewise, the Constitution obliges the Federal Council to counter political pressure from other states and to safeguard Switzerland's interests. In recent years, he has done far too little of this. Swiss interests take precedence A majority of the Federal Council and parliament would rather see Switzerland in the EU today than tomorrow. These circles are working less obviously than before, but no less consistently, to lead Switzerland into the EU. They refuse to withdraw the EU membership application in Brussels because they want to join. They ignore the negative consequences of EU accession as well as the disadvantages of various agreements negotiated with the EU. The problems with the free movement of persons, the Schengen Agreement or the introduction of the Cassis de Dijon principle are becoming increasingly obvious. However, the Federal Council is pushing for further agreements. For example, he wants agricultural free trade with the EU, which would cause massive damage to our agriculture. The fact that Switzerland is not a member of the EU today is due solely to the special case of direct democracy with the unique rights of the people to have their say. No to bad contracts The salami tactics of the EU proponents in the Federal Council, in parliament and in the administration continue. The attempt by President Calmy-Rey and Economics Minister Schneider-Ammann to launch a Bilateral III package without a clear decision by the Federal Council is a clear indication of the continuing drive towards Brussels. This package will also address the mandatory adoption of EU law and the creation of corresponding judicial, interpretative and supervisory authorities. Switzerland would thus go even further than it did at the time with the EEA. This must not be tolerated. Incorrigible EU Turbos: ""The Nebs demands the immediate launch of an internal process that prepares Switzerland for EU membership.""  http://www.europa.ch ""The SP Switzerland is the only party in the Federal Council to call for the rapid initiation of EU accession negotiations so that Switzerland does not lose further sovereignty..."" http://www.sp-ps.ch ""I assume that the majority of the Greens still see themselves as an EU-friendly party.""  Ueli Leuenberger, Party President Green Party Switzerland http://www.nzz.ch of 6.8.2010 The EU announces that the bilateral path is coming to an end for Switzerland. ""Now we have to discuss EU accession again.""  FDP National Councilor Christa Markwalder http://www.20min.ch of 20.7.2010 The SVP demands: The pending application for EU membership must finally be withdrawn. The Federal Council must inform the EU that Switzerland wants to preserve sovereignty and therefore does not enter into any institutional ties or recognize foreign judges. No international agreement should be concluded that is detrimental to our country. An overall Bilateral III package must be clearly rejected. No new commitments for direct or indirect payments to the EU (cohesion payments, IMF loans, etc.) may be made. DEMOCRACY Strengthen popular rights In preparation for EU accession, politicians and professors want to restrict and dismantle the rights of the people. If the Federal Council has its way, the grounds for invalidity of popular initiatives are to be extended and ""warning notices"" are to be placed on initiative sheets. The same circles are also obstructing the implementation of popular initiatives, e.g. the deportation initiative or the minaret initiative. They want to take rights away from the people and give more power to the authorities and courts instead. For the SVP, this is out of the question. Protect right of initiative In the future, the Federal Council would like to invalidate popular initiatives that violate ""the core content of fundamental constitutional rights"". If an initiative could lead to a possible conflict with any international treaty or any non-binding international law, a ""warning"" shall be placed on the initiative form. This is one more step on the road to dismantling the people's rights. The refusal to implement popular initiatives approved by the people, as is currently being attempted with the deportation initiative, goes in the same direction. The Federal Council would rather apologize for its people abroad, as it did after the minaret initiative. The people should have less and less to say, so that the elites can live out their fantasies in the EU and in international organizations. The Federal Council, the administration and other parties are increasingly undermining the rights of the people: All international law is placed on the level of mandatory international law and thus above Swiss legislation. As a result, decisions taken by the people at the ballot box are no longer implemented. The most recent example is the Federal Council's refusal to implement the deportation initiative approved by the people and to deport criminal foreigners. The Federal Council wants to expand the grounds for invalidity for popular initiatives and introduce a substantive preliminary examination of popular initiatives with a ""warning notice"" on the initiative sheet. As a result, all initiatives that do not suit the Federal Council receive a warning notice. The Federal Council wants to introduce constitutional jurisdiction and thus accepts the politicization of the judiciary. As a result, the judiciary, rather than the people, has the final say on changes to the law. Important People's Choice The popular election of the Federal Council, on the other hand, represents a strengthening of the people's rights. The SVP wants to decisively complete democracy at the federal level with the popular election of the Federal Council. This should be done by majority vote, as in most cantonal governments or as in most municipal councils, and with a guarantee of at least two seats for Latin Switzerland. Unlike parliament, the people will elect their government without self-serving, petty intrigues, party-political intrigues and back-stage deals. The federal councillors elected by the people would increasingly represent the people's interests. Conversely, the population would be increasingly responsible for the government and could no longer simply say, ""They up there do what they want after all."" For all these reasons, the popular election of the Federal Council will improve the political state of Switzerland. Thanks to the SVP, the Swiss people will be able to decide on the popular election of the Federal Council at the ballot box in the coming legislature. The SVP demands: A dismantling of popular rights and arbitrary influence on popular initiatives by the authorities must not be accepted under any circumstances. The democratic rights of citizens must be consistently defended. The popular election of the Federal Council brings a meaningful strengthening and completion of direct democracy. The authorities should be expected to stand behind our legal system instead of constantly following foreign law. Constitutional jurisdiction is to be dispensed with. ST A N D E R AT Light into the dark chamber of the Council of States The Council of States used to be a bourgeois bastion of stability. In recent years, however, the Council of States has become strongly Europhile and home-weary. The SVP has set itself the goal of showing what the Council of States stands for. This first requires the necessary transparency about the attitudes and voting behavior of the professional representatives in Bern. The SVP is also aiming for representation in the Council of States in the medium term in line with its strength. Slid to the left The Council of States has slid to the left in recent years. Whereas the small chamber used to be a ""safe value"" on many issues, correcting wrong decisions of the National Council in a bourgeois direction, the situation has changed fundamentally today. The consequences of this unsatisfactory situation became visible in many issues during the current legislature. For example, the Council of States rejected most attempts to tighten criminal law and curb immigration. At the same time, he proposed raising petrol prices by 30 centimes, sending the army to the Horn of Africa to combat piracy and increasingly legalizing illegal residents. Disclosure of voting behavior In the coming legislature, the question of whether Switzerland will determine its own future or subordinate itself to the EU will be of central importance. All other parties are avoiding clear positions on the EU issue. The SVP considers it an urgent task to ensure that no colonial treaty, however formulated, is concluded with the EU. To achieve this goal, we need more SVP in the Council of States. In order to shed more light on the ""dark chamber of the Council of States"", the SVP parliamentary group has demanded the disclosure of voting behavior in the Council of States, so that citizens can see how they are actually represented by their Council of States members. The SVP is fighting for more openness and transparency in the Council of States so that it does not slide further to the left and towards the EU. More SVP in the Council of States The SVP will run its own candidates in as many cantons as possible in view of the 2011 elections to the Council of States. The SVP's candidates for the Council of States stand for a home-grown policy in favor of Switzerland's independence. The SVP demands: As in the National Council, the voting behavior of the members of the Council of States must be disclosed and made transparent to every citizen. This creates more transparency and trust. The members of the Council of States should be more concerned with politics than with their lobbying assignments."
43810,201510,"Our program for a free, independent and sovereign Switzerland - Overview FOREIGN POLICY Independence and self-determination The SVP fights for an independent and neutral Switzerland. The sellout of sovereignty and self-determination by political elites must stop. Our country must not be creepingly integrated into international entities - the EU, for example. The SVP is committed to a credible policy of humanitarian aid and good offices on the basis of neutrality. Our focus: The SVP opposes creeping EU accession With the popular initiative ""Swiss law instead of foreign judges (self-determination initiative)"", the SVP ensures self-determination over one's own law and ensures that popular decisions are implemented again The SVP demands that state development aid be linked to the repatriation of asylum seekers by their countries of origin FOREIGNERS POLICY Limit immigration Switzerland has always employed foreign workers in a controlled manner and offered them existential prospects. The electorate has shown in various votes that it wants controlled immigration with clear rules that apply equally to everyone, both natives and immigrants. Those who come to Switzerland have to abide by the legal system, adapt and provide for their own livelihood. Our focus: The SVP demands the consistent implementation of the constitutional article ""against mass immigration"" (quotas and priority for Swiss nationals) approved by the Swiss electorate in order to significantly reduce immigration The SVP is fighting for the reintroduction of border controls to prevent the illegal entry of immigrants SAFETY Punish criminals, don't coddle them Switzerland was once one of the safest countries in the world. Loose policies, lax implementation of laws, and the opening of borders due to Switzerland's entry into the Schengen area led to the fact that our country is now one of the states with a high crime rate. This must not be allowed to continue - this undesirable development must be stopped! Courts that punish according to the law and consistent enforcement of sentences are the way to achieve this. Our focus: The SVP demands the consistent deportation of criminal foreigners The SVP demands that courts give greater weight to the interests of the victims than those of the perpetrators The SVP demands decisive action against criminal tourists FINANCES, TAXES AND LEVIES More for the middle class, less for the state The state is growing and proliferating: Federal spending has doubled since 1990. Because politicians lack the willingness to get a grip on the explosion in spending, taxes, levies and fees are constantly being increased even more. The middle class is paying the most expensive price. This squandering of money at the expense of the citizens must finally be stopped, because the prosperity of the country depends on the middle class being willing to perform. ARMY Against expropriation, for privacy protection The guarantee of private property is one of the most important tasks of a free democratic constitutional state. The SVP therefore fights for citizens to be able to freely dispose of their material and non-material goods. This includes the certainty that the state is not constantly reaching into people's wallets from morning to night. The defense of citizens' privacy is also becoming increasingly important: the transparent citizen must not exist in Switzerland. PROPERTY Security for country and people Security is the prerequisite for freedom, independence and prosperity. A credible militia army guarantees security even in times of crisis and is the tailor-made solution for Switzerland. Just a few hours' flight from us, war is raging - not for the first time and despite the EU's supposed peacekeeping efforts. Terrorist attacks are possible anytime and anywhere. We therefore want to provide the armed forces with the human and financial resources they need for national defense - so that everyone can live in security and freedom. The SVP is committed to an up-to-date armed and excellently trained militia army to preserve an independent, free and neutral Switzerland. AGRICULTURE For local products The SVP is committed to a productive agriculture that supplies the population with healthy food produced close to the market. For their important services to the community, farm families may expect a reasonable and living wage. The planning security and innovative strength of entrepreneurial agriculture must be strengthened. Excessive greening has been reduced to a reasonable level. The cultivated land must be taken care of. TRANSPORT Free ride without chicanes There can be no prosperity without a needs-based, well-developed and well-maintained transport infrastructure. Road must no longer be disadvantaged compared to rail. Each mode of transport should receive the financial resources it generates itself. Redistribution, cross-subsidies and misappropriation must be stopped, as must the robbery of motorists through higher taxes, fees and fines. Preserving Swiss pillars of success As a small, inherently poor country, Switzerland has developed from what was once the poorhouse of Europe into one of the most successful and prosperous countries in the world. This is largely thanks to its special form of government, namely the state pillars of independence, direct democracy, Neutrality and federalism. They form the unique ""special case Switzerland"". They are the guarantor of freedom and welfare. It is only thanks to these pillars of success that our country has been able to achieve and maintain its leading economic position in the world, and only thanks to them that freedom and welfare can be preserved. This is the only way to put citizens at the center of attention - not politicians and functionaries. Attack on the pillars of the state With the exception of the SVP, all other parties are moving to the opposite side. They infiltrate and destroy these pillars of the state. They push Switzerland into foreign domination, namely to join the EU, they want foreign law and foreign judges, so that Switzerland loses its independence. They are increasingly abolishing direct democracy by not enforcing referendums. The other parties respect foreign laws more than Swiss laws, they want to make popular initiatives and referendums more difficult. They continuously violate neutrality by taking positions on international conflicts and pushing for the UN Security Council. So they drag the war into their own country. The other parties disregard federalism by moving more and more decisions away from the cantons and municipalities to the federal government - to the detriment of our children, our families and our schools. Independence in danger The pillars of the state enshrined in the Federal Constitution have given Switzerland an exemplary openness to the world. At the same time, Switzerland has maintained its independence and has not tolerated any foreign domination. The preservation of independence is nothing less than Swiss national purpose. The seven federal councillors and all the people's representatives have taken an oath or vow to do so. But the SVP is the only party that is consistently committed to the success pillar of independence, which guarantees us freedom and welfare. The Federal Council, the parliamentary majority and the administration are doing the opposite: they are pushing ahead with creeping EU accession. They talk about ""framework agreements"" or ""institutional ties,"" but they mean the adoption of foreign law and the judgment of foreign judges. Direct democracy is being eroded Our citizens' right of co-determination is a world-wide special case. Since 1848, more elections and votes have taken place in Switzerland than in all other countries of the world combined. The Swiss can vote and elect more times in a single year than the English, for example, can in their entire lifetime. Thanks to direct democracy, our citizens are at the center of everything we do. Not only can they elect their authorities, but they can also decide on substantive issues. This prevents politicians from deciding over the heads of citizens. The SVP is the only party that unreservedly supports direct democracy. The other parties want to increasingly restrict them. They refuse to implement popular decisions, declaring even non-mandatory ""international law"" to be superior to national law. They want to make popular initiatives and referendums more difficult by pre-testing, refusing or explicitly warning against initiative proposals. Neutrality is destroyed For a small, cosmopolitan state like Switzerland, permanent armed neutrality is the most successful security concept. Switzerland has proven this over centuries: Because Switzerland does not get involved in foreign conflicts, it does not drag the war into its own country and does not create enemies unnecessarily. This leads to successful openness to the world by being on friendly terms with all states without surrendering its own sovereignty. Thus, Switzerland has not known war for 200 years. The neutral stance also requires that our authorities refrain from commenting on international conflicts. All of this is currently being disregarded in Bern, making neutrality implausible. You interfere everywhere and take big risks. The SVP is the party that stands unreservedly behind Swiss neutrality, because this offers the greatest security and openness to the world, as well as the opportunity to provide special good offices for peace. Federalism is undermined Our federal state as an association of minorities lives from the federalism of cantons and municipalities. Federalism grants citizens the best possible co-determination within a manageable framework. Centralistic decisions over the heads of the population lead to resignation, disenchantment with politics and mismanagement. The closer decisions are made to the people, the more efficiently and sensibly public funds are used. But the change parties want to restrict the proven federalism more and more. They want to transfer more and more power to the EU headquarters in Brussels and to the federal headquarters in Bern. They want to eliminate competition from cantons and municipalities as much as possible. They want to centralize schools, education, housing, taxes as much as possible and control them from the top. The SVP defends federalism against centralist encroachments that increasingly restrict the freedom of citizens. Anyone who cares about our state pillars of independence, direct democracy, neutrality and federalism votes for the Swiss People's Party. The SVP's representatives at the federal, cantonal and municipal levels are committed to defending these pillars of success with all their might and to preserving them for the future. Independence and self-determination The SVP is committed to preserving an independent and neutral Switzerland. The sell-out of Swiss sovereignty and self-determination by the political elites must be stopped. Therefore, our country must not continue to be creepingly integrated into international entities, such as the EU. The SVP is committed to a credible policy of good offices, mediation and humanitarian aid on the basis of neutrality. Constitution disregarded The objective of Swiss foreign policy is set out in Article 2 of the Federal Constitution: ""The Swiss Confederation shall protect the liberty and rights of the people and preserve the independence and security of the country."" The people as sovereign determine the fate and future of Switzerland in freedom and independence. These values enshrined in our Federal Constitution, such as freedom, self-determination, independence and neutrality, are being creepingly undermined by the Federal Council, the Federal Administration, but also by the courts and various professors of law. Neutrality is being eroded Today, for example, the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) cares little for a neutral and impartial stance in conflicts. Diplomats and federal councillors prefer to be celebrated in the spotlight, openly taking sides in power-political disputes in which they would have been better off adopting a comprehensively neutral stance for the sake of credible mediation and humanitarian aid. It is also diametrically opposed to neutrality for Switzerland to seek a seat on the UN Security Council. But this is the plan of the classe politique in Bern. The UN Security Council is the place where the so-called world peace and thus also wars and sanctions are decided. It is not possible to take an impartial stance in the process. This interference in the global scramble for power and prestige is unnecessary and dangerous for Switzerland. International law is prioritized Today, international law is openly ranked higher than the law enacted in one's own country by parliament and the people. This is reflected in the fact that more and more popular initiatives are not implemented or not implemented correctly. This foreign law, which is often deceptively referred to as international law, has little or no democratic legitimacy. The falsifying reference to human rights is also misleading. What is today called human rights in the political calculation for power and influence has nothing to do with the initial meaning, but is an ideological further development and further interpretation of the original Charter of Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights, mostly in favor of a centralist, state-believing and socialist solution. International courts are increasingly putting aside their restraint, interfering with national law and disregarding states' constitutions. Self-determination and autonomy in lawmaking are thus increasingly undermined. The creeping EU accession The grossest violation of any of Switzerland's values is the planned institutional link to the EU. The Federal Council and the EU want Switzerland to submit to the dynamic EU legal development and jurisdiction. Not only should foreign laws be adopted and foreign judges accepted, but foreign EU officials should also be allowed to unilaterally monitor and control Switzerland. A framework agreement on all other bilateral treaties is intended to enforce this institutional integration. Switzerland would have to adopt the EU's massively advancing legal developments. The flood of regulations would spill over from the EU to Switzerland. In addition, the EU Court of Justice is to be allowed to issue binding judgments against Switzerland in the event of disputes. This submissive and dependency project must therefore be prevented. Switzerland must retain its independence in order to defend its prosperity and economic success. Limit foreign aid The history of development aid is one succession of disappointments and failures. Despite decades of payments of immense sums by the West, the African continent, for example, is worse off than before. Civil wars, corruption and state collapse threaten many countries. The migration flows from south to north are still continuing and can only lead to one conclusion: the expensive state aid projects of recent decades have failed to achieve their goal. Often, not only are public funds wasted, but dictatorial, corrupt regimes and clans are indirectly kept alive. This shows that there is a greater need for action. Appropriations may not be increased. Instead, the commitment should be limited to what is essential and effective, and the emphasis should be on humanitarian aid in line with Swiss tradition. Good services The commitment of the Red Cross, Switzerland's humanitarian efforts and, for example, the location of Geneva are part of our positive international reputation and support Switzerland's impartial and all-round open attitude. This successful role is that of the paramedic on the sidelines, who provides first aid quickly, unbureaucratically, unobtrusively and impartially. Discreet diplomatic efforts for peace and reconciliation are preferable to loud declarations in the context of conference tourism. While the humanitarian commitment is to remain, development aid must be cleaned up. For example, the disbursement of development aid funds should be linked to repatriation agreements for asylum seekers. And instead of constantly increasing spending on development aid, private willingness to donate should be encouraged through tax relief. Impartiality pays off The Federal Council must return to a permanently armed, perpetual and comprehensive understanding of neutrality. Comprehensive neutrality does not only mean a purely legal and military understood neutrality (neutrality law), but additionally a lived neutrality (neutrality policy), which commits the entire action of the government in foreign policy to impartiality and non-interference at any time. For this, however, Switzerland also needs defense readiness in the form of an operational militia army with sufficient personnel, budget and material, which is what makes Switzerland's independence and neutrality credible in the first place. The Confederation must not support any unilateral sanctions policy (diplomatic, financial and economic), including those of the UN, the EU or the OSCE. Relations with the whole world Switzerland must also intensify its efforts to trade with all states and cultures and not focus unilaterally on the EU in this area. This universalistic foreign trade policy includes deliberate diversification through balanced free trade agreements with as many states as possible, because trade is also the best basis for friendly relations and lasting peace. Thus, economic linkages are also an expression of mutual common interests. Economic-political relations do not require political institutions, organizations and attempts at affiliation. One's own law must follow the law of international institutions that are remote from the citizen. Standardization and egalitarianism even contradict free trade. Freedom, innovation and success thrive on competition. Successful Switzerland thanks to EEA no The remoteness of the Brussels bureaucracy and its democratic deficits are the subject of constant criticism, and rightly so. In contrast, Switzerland is superior to the EU in all rankings: in terms of attractiveness as a business location, prosperity, social system, debt, and even in terms of the citizens' sense of happiness. If Switzerland is not a member of the EU today, it does not owe this to complacent elites in politics, business, society and the media, but solely to the special case of direct democracy with the right of the people to have their say. And it is to the SVP's credit that it has fought on the side of the people against EU and EEA accession for over two decades. Interestingly, contrary to all predictions and assertions, not joining the EEA did not herald Switzerland's demise. Since the 1990s, Switzerland has been doing better than ever economically - precisely because of its independence and autonomy. It is therefore astonishing that, in relation to the EU, the same old tune is being played today: without integration or without further agreements with the EU, we would fall into poverty, the administration and economic functionaries are trumpeting to the country. Obviously, however, these fear-mongers are not to be believed. No integration into the EU Switzerland needs good economic and friendly relations with the EU, but we are by no means dependent on state integration, which leads us only into subservience. Bilateral relations and treaties in the interest of both sides are to be advocated, but not an EU integration policy that has EU accession as its ultimate goal or makes us more and more dependent and adapted until we creep into it. Switzerland's self-determination and independence as well as the people's rights must be strengthened. Further adjustments and alignments with the EU must not be accepted. Why should we conform to an obviously worse system characterized by youth unemployment, symptoms of poverty, remoteness from citizens, bureaucracy and centralism? Switzerland's successful values such as freedom, independence, neutrality, direct democracy, federalism and market economy must be defended relentlessly. STANDPOINTS The SVP is fighting the creeping EU beltrltt. Self-determination means: no institutional integration into the EU and thus no dynamic adoption of law and no foreign judges; advocates that Swiss law prevails over international, foreign law; ensures self-determination over its own law with the popular initiative ""Swiss law instead of foreign judges (Seibstbestlmmungslnltlatlve)"" and ensures that popular decisions are implemented again; demands as the primary objectives of our foreign policy the strengthening of freedom, self-determination, popular rights, independence and neutrality of Switzerland; opposes any weakening of perpetual, permanently armed neutrality - on the contrary, it must be credibly strengthened; demands that Switzerland, as a small state, live up to the proven performance of good offices through diplomacy, the ICRC and the Humanitarian Aid Corps, instead of showing big power airs and making unilateral condemnations; opposes Switzerland's participation in the UN Security Council; demands that state development aid be linked to the repatriation of asylum seekers; seeks relations with all states of the world on the basis of classical free trade agreements instead of fixating on the EU. As a voter, this gives me the security of being able to decide for myself in the future what rules should apply in Switzerland; as an entrepreneur, good relations with the whole world; as a taxpayer, the certainty of not having to pay for the mismanagement of other countries; as a citizen, a government that stands up for the interests of Switzerland and its citizens instead of seeking the limelight of the world stage. More for the middle class, less for the state The state is growing and growing. Federal spending has doubled since 1990. The public sector is taking on more and more tasks. Since there is a lack of willingness in politics to get a grip on the explosion in spending, taxes, levies and fees are being increased. The middle class in particular is paying the bill. This dynamic must finally be broken, because the prosperity of the entire country depends on a healthy middle class. Every franc that is spent must first be earned. A policy of unrestrained spending Despite positive financial statements, federal finances are in poor shape, fueled by an expansionary spending policy. Whereas in 1990 a good 32 billion francs were spent, in 2013 the figure was 64 billion francs, which corresponds to a doubling. In 2018, the Federal Council would like to spend 73 billion francs according to the financial plan. The path of least resistance While savings have been made in agriculture and the army for years, other areas continue to grow unabated. By far the largest expenditure item is social welfare. It now takes up one-third of total federal spending. Contrary to the left-wing mantra that ""social cuts"" are being carried out in Switzerland and that the state is being ""cut to the bone,"" the social sector is actually flourishing. Since the beginning of this millennium alone, spending has increased from 14 billion Swiss francs (2000) to 21 billion Swiss francs (2013), i.e. it has been halved. More money is spent on social welfare alone than on education, transport and national defense combined. The administration grows at the expense of all of us The federal administration has also grown rapidly in recent years. While personnel expenses were still at 4.5 billion Swiss francs in 2007, they were already 5.5 billion Swiss francs in 2014, an increase of more than one fifth in just seven years. Around half of this growth (520 million) is attributable to 1,200 new jobs and function changes. In total, more than 33,000 people work for the federal government today. Stop the bus terror In addition to taxes, levies and fees, which have been increased at various levels in recent years (e.g. VAT, CCb levies, ALV solidarity percentage, waste and wastewater charges, etc.), the public sector is increasingly raising funds through fines. Many cantons have increased their revenues from this inconspicuously but steadily in recent years. Fines and fees are becoming more and more fiscal in nature. The effect as a punishment or to increase safety recedes into the background. The mechanism for fines is clear: thanks to more fine revenue, the authorities can access citizens' money relatively easily, whereas taxes can only be increased with the consent of the people. So that more remains to live Prosperity and jobs can only be preserved if citizens and companies can once again dispose more freely of their money. Today, we have to work almost half of the year for compulsory government charges (taxes, premiums, levies and fees). Only a significant reduction in the burden of taxes and duties will lead to more private investment, more consumption and thus more growth, jobs and apprenticeships. The SVP therefore opposes all new taxes, levies and fees and, on the contrary, calls for tax relief. Questions of interpretation shall be settled in favor of the population and enterprises liable to pay taxes and duties. Lean state The SVP is strongly in favor of a cost-effective, streamlined state. From the SVP's point of view, it is essential that the leverage is applied to the expenditure side and to the structures. It must not be the case that new sources of revenue are constantly being tapped to finance ever-increasing government tasks. The SVP sees a particular need for action in the exploding expenditure on social welfare, which now accounts for one in three federal francs. Structural measures to safeguard our social achievements are imperative here. There must be no further expansion. Similarly, the massive increase in spending on foreign and development aid must be curtailed. Preserve tax competition The SVP is the party of federalism and thus of the tax sovereignty of the cantons and municipalities. Only in this way can competition take place, and only in this way are governments that have become comfortable forced to shape their tax policies in favor of citizens instead of in the service of their administrative interests. Pressure from abroad on the Swiss tax system must be resisted. Internationally advantageous special tax regulations are only to be adjusted if they are compensated by tax relief in other areas. The SVP is committed to making Switzerland a competitive tax location for all companies. STANDPOINTS The SVP advocates low taxes, levies and fees for all and rejects any new ones; fights at all levels of the polity to ensure that the state does not spend more than it takes in and that expenditure is in line with revenue and not vice versa ; demands that the state does not grow faster than the economy; calls for the reduction of the federal workforce to 2007 levels (2007:32,105; 2014:33,678) and a massive reduction in financial personnel expenses; demands internationally competitive corporate taxation; rejects a further increase in the value-added tax, as well as the introduction of a uniform rate that would make luxury goods cheaper and basic foodstuffs more expensive; Calls for a reduction in the taxation of business assets in the case of sole proprietorships and partnerships; opposes any kind of inheritance tax; calls for the abolition of the marriage penalty, which puts married couples at a tax disadvantage; calls for fines not to be misused as a convenient source of revenue for the state treasury. As an employee, this puts more in my wallet at the end of the month and secures my job; lower prices as a consumer; as a car and motorcyclist less bus terror and moderate gasoline prices; as an entrepreneur more money for investments in the future. More economic freedom instead of bureaucracy The SVP fights for more entrepreneurial freedom and against ever new laws and bans that burden our companies. The tendencies of recent years to regulate the liberal labor market more and more, to make energy and transportation more expensive and to increase bureaucracy must finally be stopped. Our successful small and medium-sized enterprises, but also the many large companies based in Switzerland, must be taken care of. The SVP stands for Swiss quality and fights for competitive framework conditions to secure jobs in Switzerland. Difficult times for liberal economic policy Social is who creates jobs. Because work is the most reliable remedy against poverty. This is the reason why liberal market economies have historically and globally been the most successful and have the least poverty. Our country is still quite well positioned economically if you compare it with various EU countries, for example. But productivity is stagnating, and in terms of per capita income, Switzerland has fallen steadily behind other countries since 1980. Only if companies find advantageous conditions in which investments are worthwhile will jobs and prosperity also be created. The public sector is growing In recent years, employment has grown almost exclusively in the public sector, administration, health care and social services. Between 2008 and 2014, two out of three new jobs were created at public ffand. The large number of newly created government positions is a burden not only on taxpayers, but also on the economy. More civil servants automatically lead to even more government bureaucracy and actionism. Because all those officials also want something to do. The market and competition are then replaced by state regulations and interventionism as well as international egalitarianism, which force entrepreneurs out of the market. Unnecessary monopolies such as the post office, Suva or SRG also make services more expensive and prevent real competition. Financial center under constant fire In addition, the duty of every employer and trader to make a profit is now morally questioned. Yet capable entrepreneurs, tradesmen and craftsmen are the true social workers in our country. The financial center has been under particular pressure recently. The banking, insurance and financial sector accounts for a full 22 percent of Switzerland's total economic output. Envy and bankrupt foreign treasuries make this industry a target for hostile attacks from abroad, which find compliant helpers at home, right up to the Federal Council. Thus, banking secrecy and financial privacy are being increasingly eroded vis-à-vis foreign countries, and locational advantages are being surrendered with reference to some international standard or consumer protection. Tourism under pressure Tourism, with its numerous jobs, is also of great importance to the Swiss economy. However, the unique scenic beauty of our country is also contrasted by burdensome factors such as a strong franc, high costs or outdated structures. Tourism companies can overcome many, but not all, of the problems on their own; however, they depend on certain basic conditions to ensure that their investments actually pay off. The SVP demands the reduction of the VAT rate for the hotel and catering industry to the reduced rate. Strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises Two-thirds of Swiss employees (2013: 67.9 percent) are employed in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with fewer than 250 employees. SMEs thus represent the real backbone of our national economy. The SVP is aware of their importance and is particularly committed to their welfare. The SVP's National Councillors have been the strongest supporters of SME-related business issues, according to a survey conducted by the Swiss Trade Association. An analysis of 215 votes on 169 SME-relevant topics between 2011 and 2014 in the National Council shows that 41 members of the SVP are among the first 50 National Councilors. SVP representatives occupy the first four ranks in the Council of States. No other party represents business and industry as consistently as the SVP. The SVP rejects unnecessary regulations, new laws, rules and bans that are poison for companies and businesses. Back to liberal values The state must neither compete with nor hinder the economy, but should provide the basic conditions for economic activity to be as free as possible. Because where bureaucracy proliferates, entrepreneurial activity is inevitably restricted and regulatory costs get out of hand. State-imposed bureaucratic idleness harms companies and thus Switzerland. The SVP therefore advocates that instead of increasing state actionism, there should once again be a greater focus on individual responsibility. The flexible labor market, solidly anchored in the social partnership, is one of the greatest assets of Switzerland as a workplace. The more liberal the working conditions can be, the more likely it is that full employment can be achieved. Likewise, care must be taken of our unique dual vocational training system, which is the world's best protection against youth unemployment. Preserve bank client confidentiality The SVP opposes all efforts to weaken our traditional banking secrecy and the financial privacy of citizens. This was created in the interest of bank customers, not banks. Stamp taxes, which keep many attractive businesses away from Switzerland, must be abolished. In the area of European and global legislation, the SVP fights for Switzerland to adopt only those ""international standards"" that are mandatory to secure global market access. Trade with the whole world In the area of foreign trade, the SVP is committed to good trade relations with the whole world. In doing so, Switzerland should not only focus on the EU, but also open up new markets that are currently showing the highest growth rates. Free trade agreements, which are of mutual interest, enable the development of the open Swiss economy. STANDPOINTS The SVP stands up for small, medium and large companies as the backbone of our prosperity; demands more freedom and no new regulations and bans without abolishing at least as many; opposes quota regulations, wage police, joint and several liability and other harmful harassment of companies by the state; demands that the state neither competes with nor hinders the economy; wants to preserve the Swiss franc as an independent and autonomous currency; stands by the Swiss financial center and Swiss bank-client confidentiality; calls for the reduction of the VAT rate for the hotel and restaurant industry to the reduced rate; calls for an exemption from the statistics requirement for businesses with less than 50 full-cell positions and a reduction to a minimum for all others; calls for an increase in the threshold for declaring collective labor agreements generally binding. This brings me, as an employee, a secure job; as an entrepreneur, more money for innovations; as a trader and producing farmer, less bureaucracy and paperwork; as a hotelier and restaurateur, more customers. Against expropriation, for the protection of privacy The guarantee of private property is one of the most important tasks of a liberal democratic state. The SVP is committed to ensuring that citizens can freely dispose of their acquired material and non-material goods. This includes the state leaving as much money as possible in its citizens' wallets for their free disposal. However, defending the privacy of citizens is becoming increasingly important in our time. The transparent citizen must not be allowed to exist. Against left redistribution Anyone who works and has put aside some money on their own responsibility and still wants something from their savings later has every reason to fight left-wing policies. Most of their proposals are aimed at getting more money from others, taking people's property and redistributing it. No one thinks more materialistically and selfishly than the political left, which wants to solve every problem with other people's money. Whether it's the integration of foreigners, early retirement, childcare places, crèches, day schools, parental leave, social housing: for the left, everything is a question of money, which the classe politique may dispose of and which must be redistributed. The state grows and grows The state has grown ever larger in recent years and has greatly increased the density of regulation; this is evidenced by the massive increase in the fiscal quota (sum of total taxes and levies in relation to gross domestic product). We work an increasingly large part of the year to pay for taxes, duties and fees. More and more tasks that used to be solved privately are being taken over by the state. Mr. and Mrs. Swiss have to spend around 50 percent of their income on taxes and duties. That is, six months a year we work for the state. This puts Switzerland above the average for OECD countries. More freedom for home ownership The property of the Swiss is not only threatened by the increasing tax burden. The acquisition of residential property is also threatened by increasing government requirements and restrictions. This also harms tenants, because only as long as investing, building and renovating is worthwhile will sufficient living space be created at reasonable prices. However, the play of the free market is already severely restricted in today's tenancy law by over-regulation. Less and less private In addition to property, leftists and other believers in the state also want to take away our privacy: Abolition of bank client confidentiality, automatic exchange of information, restriction of cash transactions, surveillance at every turn. The state is interfering ever more brazenly in our private lives with the aim of educating citizens and taking even more money out of their pockets. The SVP does not accept this. Instead, the privacy of citizens must be respected and protected. That is why the SVP supports efforts to enshrine the protection of privacy in the Federal Constitution. The SVP fights just as vehemently for the preservation of bank client confidentiality in Switzerland and against more and more possibilities for the authorities to interfere with citizens' privacy and to monitor and violate it. Strengthen ownership The SVP is committed to ensuring that citizens can freely dispose of their legally acquired material and non-material goods. Without constitutionally guaranteed property, neither the individual's right to self-determination nor a free and prosperous society is possible. History has shown time and time again that as soon as a state no longer guarantees its inhabitants their property or even takes it away, people's lives and limb are soon endangered. In particular, the SVP opposes the ban on early withdrawal of personally saved retirement capital in the second pillar to finance owner-occupied residential property or to start one's own small business. This ban is tantamount to expropriation of citizens. Less government redistribution Likewise, the SVP is fighting against even more redistribution. In the sense of a liberal state based on personal responsibility, every citizen should be able to use his property and money as freely as possible in the way he sees fit. The SVP does not want a state that takes people's hard-earned money out of their pockets and redistributes it - even if the idea behind it is well-intentioned. Every citizen knows best where and how he wants to use his money on his own responsibility. If this principle is further undermined, it leads to socialism, in which the state takes away property from citizens for the purposes it sets. Less bureaucracy in planning and building law In the real estate sector, the SVP is calling for a relaxation of rental management regulations and rent control. The SVP calls for home and apartment ownership to be promoted through tax incentives. The current imputed rental value taxation has an anti-ownership effect and should therefore be abolished. The SVP rejects state social housing. Social housing always leads to competition-distorting effects that negatively impact private investment. STANDPOINTS The SVP upholds the protection of private property and combats tendencies to restrict the use of cash and the state's recourse to savings and pension fund assets; is committed to opposing anti-economic regulations in tenancy law and the real estate sector; advocates the abolition of property-related imputed rental value taxation while retaining the deductions for maintenance expenses and debt interest that promote investment; does not want unreasonable progressive tax rates; defends intellectual property as an important basis for Switzerland as a research and production location; is committed to the protection of privacy and against excessive state surveillance. That gives me, as a citizen, the right to self-determination; more to life as a family; as an employee or pensioner, less burden from taxes and contributions; as the owner of the house, the security of my property; as a bank customer, the protection of my privacy; as an entrepreneur the well-deserved reward from my developments and innovations. Limit immigration Switzerland has always been generous but controlled in accepting foreign workers and offering them career prospects. The Swiss electorate has shown in various votes that it wants controlled immigration with clear rules that apply to everyone. Those who come to Switzerland must abide by the local legal system, integrate and support themselves. Only those who fulfill this requirement should also be given the opportunity to naturalize after a certain period of time. Attractive Switzerland Immigration to our country is attractive to foreigners for economic, political and social reasons. Our political system, our stability, our security, the liberal economic order and last but not least the beautiful landscape have led to the fact that hardly any country comes off better in international comparisons regarding quality of life than Switzerland. In short: It is worthwhile for foreigners to immigrate to Switzerland. But it will take revenge for the Swiss if they do not control and limit this immigration. Massive population increase due to immigration Since 2007, around 80,000 more people have immigrated to Switzerland each year than emigrated. In 2013, there were more than 85,000 net immigrants (a good 155,000 immigrants out of around 70,000 emigrants). Year after year, this corresponds to an increase in population in the order of more than the city of Lucerne, in two years even the population of the city of Geneva or Basel. Annually, this requires a settlement area the size of 4,560 football fields. At the end of 2014, around 8.2 million people lived in Switzerland - 2 million of them foreigners. In about 20 years, without controlling immigration, the 10 million mark will be reached. More than 80,000 net persons immigrate to Switzerland every year Massive immigration has consequences for all The consequences of this disastrous development can be felt and experienced by everyone on a daily basis: rising unemployment (among foreigners, the unemployment rate was 9.2 percent at the beginning of 2014), overcrowded trains, congested roads, rising rents and land prices, loss of valuable cultivated land due to urbanization of the landscape, wage pressure, displacement on the labor market, cultural change in management levels and burdensomely high proportions of foreigners in welfare and other social services. Today's excessive immigration threatens our freedom, security, full employment, our landscape and ultimately our prosperity. Steadily rising proportion of foreigners With the massive immigration of recent years, the proportion of foreigners in the population has also increased from year to year. While 6 percent of the population were foreigners in 1950 and 14.4 percent in 1980, by the end of 2013 the figure had risen to 23.8 percent. And this despite the fact that more than one million foreigners have been naturalized since 1960. The proportion of foreigners in Switzerland is also among the highest in an international comparison. No European country with more than 1 million inhabitants has a higher proportion of foreigners than Switzerland. High naturalization figures for years The leftists try to explain the high proportion of foreigners by saying that Switzerland is very restrictive on naturalization. However, this contradicts the naturalization statistics. Since 2002, Switzerland has naturalized between 35,000 and 45,000 foreigners each year. Measured against the total population, this is very high by international standards. For every 1000 inhabitants, 4.6 foreigners were naturalized in 2011. In Europe, this figure was only higher in small Luxembourg, which has granted an excessive number of citizenships in recent years due to the change in naturalization criteria in 2008. Problems ""naturalized The mass naturalizations of recent years have resulted in many people receiving a Swiss passport who are not integrated at all. Quite a few new Swiss do not understand the national language, do not recognize the local customs or become delinquent shortly after naturalization. Statistically, however, these persons are then recorded as Swiss. This has simply ""naturalized"" many foreigner problems. Naturalization should be the last step of integration and may be granted only in case of correct behavior, own livelihood and good knowledge of at least one national language. Soon more foreigners than Swiss Without immigration control, people will be living in Switzerland in less than 50 years over 16 million inhabitants more foreigners than Swiss State integration support as the new miracle cure Integration is the task of the immigrants. Anyone who wants to immigrate to a country must also want to integrate there. Today, however, politicians are increasingly pursuing the opposite approach: the authorities are supposed to ensure that foreigners integrate. The incentive for integration is to be bought with expensive state measures and offers - financed with tax money. We have the absurd situation of an ever louder droning integration industry. Without considering that integration can only succeed if it starts with the immigrant himself and is wanted by him, social workers, therapists and directors of pointless free courses have taken on the task of promoting integration and make a good living from it. The people have had enough The grievances in connection with immigration also move the electorate. This led to the Swiss electorate accepting the popular initiative ""Against Mass Immigration"" on February 9, 2014. Their consistent implementation will be the SVP's main demand in immigration policy in the coming years. With the new constitutional provision, immigration should once again be controlled independently by Switzerland by means of quotas and priority for Swiss nationals. The initiative allows for moderate control that is acceptable to the economy and in harmony with the sovereignty of the cantons. The Federal Council and Parliament must now address these domestic policy measures to implement the new constitutional provision without delay. Restrict social benefits and family reunification Clear restrictions on family reunification and social benefits should ensure that fewer foreigners who cannot support themselves and only want to live off the state immigrate to Switzerland from the outset. For example, the principle should apply that only those who have paid unemployment insurance contributions for at least two years receive unemployment benefits. Such time limits are also to be prescribed throughout Switzerland for the receipt of welfare benefits. In the case of family reunification, it must be ensured that only those persons are allowed to reunite with their families who can also provide for them and have an appropriately large, self-financed apartment. Lowering the demands on the state in this way can greatly reduce immigration without depriving the economy of important skilled workers. Free movement of persons has ended As soon as the domestic implementation process has been completed, the Federal Council must negotiate with the EU on an amendment to the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons. If the EU does not agree to a new arrangement on the free movement of persons for the non-EU country of Switzerland, the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons must be terminated. The SVP has prepared a corresponding popular initiative for this case. It will launch this if the Federal Council and Parliament refuse to effectively implement the new constitutional provision. Consistent policy even with illegal attendees Switzerland must also finally crack down on illegal immigration and illegal residence. Persons who do not have a residence permit and are therefore illegally present - so-called ""Sans Papiers"" - must leave Switzerland immediately. For this purpose, the laws on foreigners, which would actually regulate this clearly, must be applied strictly and consequently. Newly introduced regulations, according to which illegal residents are allowed to attend schools and complete fehren, contradict any understanding of the law and disadvantage those foreigners who are trying to obtain regular residence in Switzerland. Persons apprehended without valid residence documents must be deported. In order to make illegal entry impossible, border controls must be reintroduced. Integration is the task of immigrants Integration is to be demanded from the immigrants. Those who do not want to integrate will not do so even if they can attend a free course. Integration can only work if the immigrant wants it. This can be expected of anyone immigrating to a foreign country. Swiss people who emigrate abroad must also integrate themselves, learn the language and customs, abide by the law and support themselves. In this sense, it is clear: integration is primarily the task of each immigrant and must be demanded of them. Anyone who refuses to learn a Swiss national language, who disregards Swiss laws or who does not provide for his or her own livelihood must leave Switzerland. Naturalization as the final step in integration Only those who have successfully integrated and have mastered a national language should also be given the opportunity to naturalize. The SVP demands that naturalization once again become a political act without the possibility of appeal. Thus, the SVP also opposes any further facilitation of naturalization, especially that of spouses. Persons with a criminal past or dependence on the state should not be eligible for naturalization. To prevent naturalized citizens from becoming criminals shortly after receiving citizenship, probationary naturalization should be introduced. Only those who have proven over several years that they abide by our legal system should finally receive the Swiss passport. Position The SVP demands the immediate and consistent implementation of the popular initiative ""against mass immigration"" with regard to quotas and priority for Swiss nationals with the aim of significantly reducing immigration; demands the restriction of family reunification and social benefits for immigrants; launches a popular initiative to terminate the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons with the EU in the event that the implementation of the popular initiative ""against mass immigration"" is thwarted by the Federal Council and Parliament; demands that everyone abide by the local rules, customs and practices; opposes the inflation of expensive state integration measures; Opposes any further facilitation of naturalization; opposes the naturalization of criminals and welfare recipients; calls for naturalization on probation so that citizenship can be revoked from persons who become criminals shortly after receiving a Swiss passport; Opposes any form of voting and electoral rights for foreigners; demands strict and consistent application of the laws on foreigners vis-à-vis illegal residents and ""sans papiers""; demands the reintroduction of border controls to prevent the entry of illegal immigrants. This gives me, as a citizen, a Switzerland worth living in and intact; as an employee, less wage pressure and less crowding out on the labor market; as an unemployed person has more opportunities compared to cheap foreign labor; less congested roads and trains as a commuter; more affordable apartments as tenants; as a citizen more security and the certainty that abuses will not be tolerated. End asylum chaos at last The chaos in the asylum system and the high attractiveness of Switzerland for bogus refugees have led to a massive increase in asylum applications in recent years. Switzerland is one of the countries worldwide with the most applications per inhabitant. The SVP is declaring war on the misguided asylum policy, which is leading to exploding costs, more crime and accommodation problems. Humane, not naive Switzerland has always taken in people who were persecuted in their home countries and whose lives were threatened. Our humanitarian tradition predates any international refugee or human rights convention. But having a humanitarian tradition and wanting to continue it does not mean being led around by the nose. More and more people come to Switzerland without a visa or residence permit and try to stay here via the asylum route and live from A to Z off the state and thus off the Swiss taxpayer. Rising number of applications at highest level worldwide This is reflected in the number of asylum applications. While this was reduced to a good lO'OOO applications per year during the term of office of SVP Federal Councilor Christoph Blocher, it has more than doubled again to date. A reduction seems to be a distant prospect - since this is not even being sought politically by the responsible Federal Councilor. Looking at the absolute number of applications on the one hand and the relation to the country's population and area on the other, there was no other country in the world with more asylum applications than Switzerland on all three counts in 2013. This is despite the fact that we are surrounded by safe countries that, according to the Dublin Agreement, should register asylum seekers entering through their country and carry out the appropriate procedures. Swiss asylum system too attractive If someone enters Switzerland illegally and applies for asylum here, they receive state support from day one. He can get free medical checkups and care, he can move around completely freely, and he is happily welcomed, counseled, and cared for by asylum lawyers and aid workers. Since this ""asylum industry"" lives from chaos and protracted applications in the asylum system, it naturally has no interest in discouraging pointless appeals or encouraging its protégés to return home. It is therefore not surprising that the procedures often drag on immeasurably and lead to the fact that even persons for whom it is clear from the outset that they are not being persecuted are allowed to remain in Switzerland for years, sometimes their entire lives. Schengen/Dublin collapsed The rising asylum figures also have to do with the Schengen/Dublin agreements, according to which Switzerland is no longer allowed to systematically control its borders, as illegal immigration should be warded off at the Schengen external border. But today, the exact opposite is happening in the Mediterranean: the concept applied hardly discourages anyone from crossing and, on the contrary, facilitates and encourages illegal immigration. Unscrupulous smugglers and human traffickers are the profiteers. Once in Europe, only a part of the immigrants is registered, which means that Italy, but also Spain and other Mediterranean countries are clearly in violation of the Dublin Agreement. The migrants can thus travel unhindered and unregistered to Northern Europe and Switzerland, where they make their first asylum application. As a result, the Schengen/Dublin association agreements not only cost many times more than what was promised to the electorate before the vote, but also have the wrong effect: instead of more security and fewer asylum seekers, the agreements bring Switzerland less security, more illegal immigration and crime. The costs for the asylum sector are increasing markedly The steady increase in asylum applications also has an impact on the costs of the asylum system. For example, an amount of over one billion Swiss francs has been budgeted for this area at the federal level for 2015. These costs do not include all expenses that have to be borne by the cantons and municipalities. Although no official figures are recorded for this, they are likely to be at least in a similar range to the federal government's costs. Excessively high crime rate among asylum seekers High costs, especially in the cantons, are also incurred in the fight against criminality and in the penal system. This is because asylum seekers violate the Swiss legal system many times more frequently than Swiss or other resident foreigners do. While persons in the asylum sector make up about 0.6 percent of the population, on average over the last 4 years (2011 - 2014), 9 percent of all criminal code violations were committed by them. Those who violate the legal order of a host state in such a way cannot really be threatened in life and limb, otherwise they would not jeopardize their safe haven with criminal behavior. Unruly and delinquent asylum seekers should be sent to closed centers and quickly expelled from the country. Enforcement problems worsen the situation The problems in today's asylum mess are exacerbated by poor enforcement. Because today, fewer and fewer rejected asylum seekers are actually sent back - whether because they do not want to obtain travel documents, because they go into hiding, or because Switzerland does not insist enough on compliance with international obligations with the countries of origin or the Dublin states concerned. Without effective enforcement, however, there can be no credible asylum policy. Political leadership decisive The fact that asylum applications and costs for the asylum sector have been significantly reduced under Federal Councilor Christoph Blocher shows that much can be achieved with a consistent asylum policy and efficient implementation of existing legislation. Here, the responsibility clearly lies with the responsible member of the Federal Council and his political will. This is not present with the current departmental leadership. Instead of solving the problems, they rush from announcement to announcement and pass the buck to the cantons and municipalities. They then have to solve accommodation issues and security problems that shouldn't exist in the first place. It is imperative to ensure at the federal level that Switzerland becomes unattractive for bogus asylum seekers and economic migrants. On the one hand, this requires measures to prevent them from coming to Switzerland in the first place. On the other hand, far-reaching measures must be taken in procedures and enforcement to improve the situation so that those who are truly persecuted can be helped quickly and asylum abusers can be sent back quickly. Measures against illegal entry The most effective and fundamentally simplest way to solve the problems in the asylum system would be to ensure that bogus refugees do not come to Switzerland in the first place. Since control at the Schengen external border has been proven not to work and individual EU states do not adhere to the Dublin Agreement, Switzerland must once again systematically control its borders itself. The Border Guard Corps must be equipped with modern technical surveillance equipment and supported by the cantonal police corps. No entry from safe countries Illegal entry and residence, as well as aiding and abetting, must be prosecuted consistently. Anyone who enters Switzerland from a state in which he is not persecuted should in principle not be entitled to asylum, since genuinely persecuted persons should already have found protection in that state. This principle, on which the Dublin Agreement is also based, must finally be enforced. In the case of war refugees, the focus should also be on providing assistance locally and in their immediate geographic environment. Switzerland is involved in various international initiatives in this area, e.g. within the framework of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Annual asylum applications 2001 - 2014: A question of leadership Shorten procedures, reduce attractiveness But it is not only illegal entry that must be tackled, it must also be ensured that it is no longer worthwhile for bogus refugees to apply for asylum in Switzerland. The attractiveness of the Swiss asylum system must therefore be significantly reduced. On the one hand, the procedures must be massively shortened by limiting the possibilities for appeal, which today open the door to abuse. On the other hand, social benefits must be reduced so that the incentive for recognized refugees to work increases. During the procedure, asylum seekers should be housed in controlled centers and receive emergency assistance in kind. Anyone with an ongoing case must also be available for questioning. This can be ensured with a controlled center. Those who do not comply with these rules or the Swiss legal system should be placed in a closed center for the duration of the proceedings. Measures to simplify enforcement The solution to the problems in the asylum system stands and falls with the enforcement, i.e. with the removal of rejected asylum seekers. Persons with a rejected asylum application must be returned to their home country as quickly as possible. In the period before removal, these persons should only receive emergency assistance in kind. Those who resist the rejection are to be expelled by force. Bureaucratic and administrative requirements for expulsion should be reduced, and readmission agreements should be concluded and implemented with as many countries as possible. States that do not take back their citizens expelled by Switzerland should no longer receive development aid. STANDPOINTS The SVP advocates an asylum system that consistently sends back bogus asylum seekers and economic migrants so that those who are genuinely persecuted can be helped; demands that the Federal Council work to enforce the Dublin Agreement and consequently that persons entering from safe third countries no longer receive asylum procedures; demands that rejected asylum seekers be returned immediately - if necessary with forced deportations; demands only first-instance decisions with an appeal option instead of the current procedure with numerous appeal options, which opens the door to abuse; does not accept that cantons provide social assistance to persons with a legally binding deportation decision who should have left Switzerland a long time ago; calls for the reduction of emergency assistance for persons with a rejected asylum application; wants border controls - namely with Italy - to be intensified in order to get illegal immigration under control; Calls for the abolition of the status of provisional admission and demands instead the consistent verification of the fulfillment of refugee characteristics; calls for controlled centers for asylum seekers in the ongoing asylum procedure and closed centers for recalcitrant and delinquent asylum seekers; advocates that for war refugees, on-site assistance should be the priority. That gives me more security as a citizen; as a taxpayer, fewer bogus asylum seekers on my back; As a resident of my community, I have fewer problems with criminal asylum seekers; as a citizen, the continuation of Switzerland's humanitarian tradition; As a genuine refugee, I can guarantee that the system will not be burdened by abuses. Punishing criminals instead of coddling them Switzerland was once one of the safest countries in the world. Loose policies, inconsistent implementation of existing laws, and the opening of borders due to Switzerland's accession to the Schengen area led to the fact that our country is now one of the countries in Europe with a high crime rate. But Switzerland must not become an Eldorado for criminals. A policy with tangible penalties and consistent enforcement must finally be enforced. Uncertainty grows Every eight minutes, burglars break into an apartment or house somewhere in Switzerland. There are 932 burglaries per year for every lOO'OOO inhabitants. This makes Switzerland the number one destination in Europe for gangs and thieves. Many no longer feel safe in our country. Older people do not dare to go out on the street after dark. Young people are threatened and attacked on the way out. Refusal of the order of the policy Foreigner crime is steadily on the rise. On November 28, 2010, voters and a majority of the cantons approved the popular initiative on the deportation of criminal foreigners. Instead of implementing the will of the people quickly and consistently, four and a half years after the vote, Parliament is presenting an implementation variant that is based on the rejected and unsuitable counter-proposal to the popular initiative. Thousands of foreign criminals have therefore not been deported or banned from entering the country since the initiative was adopted. The SVP felt compelled to submit an enforcement initiative in December 2012 so that the classe poli- tique in Bern would finally act. So far, there has only been maneuvering and delaying. The people will once again have to show the way. Toothless criminal law The revised Criminal Code provides for three types of punishment for felonies or misdemeanors: imprisonment, fines and community service. Any of these penalties may be conditional or partial. The revision of the Criminal Code introduced fines and, with the consent of the offenders, community service, which were to replace the short prison sentences pronounced until then. The revision of the law has led to offenders not feeling the sanctions, as they can be imposed conditionally. From drug dealers to thieves to violent criminals, criminals are set free again after a brief interrogation by the police, while the blameless citizen, on the other hand, is really fleeced, for example, with traffic fines. Young people at risk Our criminal justice system today is ailing in several areas. On the one hand, sentences are too lenient, especially for violent offenses. Many judges do not exhaust the possible range of punishment. Too many sentences that are too lenient and lax enforcement ensure that the necessary deterrent effect is lacking. Another problem is that some procedures are far too long. Our criminal law is now heavily weighted toward finding a sanction for offenders that is accommodating and helpful, one that gives greater weight to the therapeutic effect than to the punitive and deterrent character. In the process - especially in the case of violent crimes - the victim is forgotten. Tightening in the area of juvenile criminal law is also indicated. Word has got around in organized crime circles that 17-year-old offenders are subject to considerably more lenient punishments and sanctions, which is why more and more children are being recruited to commit crimes. Boundlessness as a problem The Schengen Agreement aims to promote the free movement of people by abolishing systematic and suspicionless checks on persons at internal borders. However, open borders also mean open avenues for crime tourists and illegal immigration. Foreign gangs of thieves organize regular robberies through our country. In 2013, 75% of the 10,982 criminals convicted for theft were foreigners. Only one in five of these foreigners has a permanent residence in Switzerland or a B or C establishment. Moreover, with Schengen, Switzerland has given up its autonomy in issuing visas. Problems also exist at the Schengen external border. This is as full of holes as a sieve. Enforce referendums With the enforcement initiative, the SVP has shown how the deportation initiative is to be implemented. The fact that the SVP was forced to do this at all shows how disrespectfully popular decisions are treated. The enforcement initiative lists two types of offenses: Anyone who commits a serious offense (e.g. intentional homicide, murder, grievous bodily harm, robbery, human trafficking, rape, etc.) will be expelled from the country. Anyone who commits a minor offense (e.g. deprivation of liberty, arson, violence and threats against public officials, etc.) will be expelled from the country if he or she already had a criminal record. This implementation proposal is proportionate and should have been implemented long ago. Zero tolerance for violence The SVP demands significantly higher penalties for violent crimes, especially in cases where police officers or civil servants are attacked. In criminal law, only harsh sanctions can have a deterrent effect. In order to limit the judge's room for maneuver, minimum sentences are therefore increasingly indicated. Juvenile criminal law, which applies to underage offenders, urgently needs to be tightened. The judiciary must be given the opportunity to apply adult criminal law to underage offenders as well. In addition, there is a need to move away from expensive, therapy-heavy enforcement. Imprisonment is not meant to be a wellness stay. Control borders Switzerland must return to controlling its borders as it did before joining Schengen. A country that opens its borders without control forfeits an essential element of its sovereignty. A system of open borders from Poland to Portugal and from Romania to Belgium puts Switzerland at a disadvantage in terms of security. That a complete control of the border is not possible is undisputed. However, it has a deterrent effect that should not be underestimated if a check must be expected every time a border is crossed. It is not surprising that crimes of criminal tourists are committed at the borders and in villages and towns along the highways. Shortly after the crime, the perpetrators are out of the country again. Switzerland must also decide independently again on the issuance of visas and not blindly accept Schengen visas. STANDPOINTS The SVP demands that the interests of the victims are consistently given greater weight than those of the perpetrators; - demands the consistent implementation of the deportation of criminal foreigners. The SVP has shown a suitable way forward with its enforcement initiative; - demands that swift and consistent action be taken against violent offenders for the safety of the population; demands the reintroduction of unconditional custodial sentences even for less than six months; demands the abolition of conditional fines; demands that offenders can be sentenced to community service even without their consent. Anyone who refuses to do so will have to serve twice as long a prison sentence; calls for an increase in the minimum sentence for crimes against life and limb and for judges to make use of the scope for longer sentences in the Criminal Code; calls for a criminal record in which serious crimes are not deleted so that repeat offenses can be effectively prevented; supports tougher sentences and fast court landings, especially in juvenile criminal law; calls for a ban on veiling in public places; calls for a rethink of the penal system: less therapy, more work and participation in the costs incurred; wants dual citizenship as well as a migration background to be shown in federal crime statistics; demands effective measures against crime tourism, especially at the borders; demands that Switzerland reintroduce border controls and strive for Schengen exit. This gives me as a citizen security against break-ins and theft; as a young person, less bullying and harassment on the way out; As a victim of violence, you can be sure that the perpetrators will be taken off the streets; As a judge and police officer, I need an effective legal basis in order to be able to really take action in cases of crime. Security for the country and its people Security is an indispensable prerequisite for freedom, independence and prosperity. A credible militia army guarantees this security even in times of crisis and is the tailor-made solution for Switzerland's needs. Safety cannot be taken for granted. Today, warlike conflicts rage just a few hours away from us by plane. Terrorist attacks are possible anytime and anywhere. We are obliged to continue to provide the necessary resources for our armed forces and national defense in the future - so that the country and its people can live in security and freedom. Army as insurance With its militia army, Switzerland defends its country and its people from any violent external threat. Perpetual armed neutrality has preserved our country's independence, peace and freedom. The army secures life and limb, property and living space for citizens, but also direct democratic rights as the supreme sovereign authority. A country that cannot or will not provide for its own security is also no longer sovereign. The army is the last resort in defense of our freedom. That is why this last resort must never fail. Wars are unfortunately a fact The outbreak of an everlasting peace among the nations is not to be seen. On the contrary, tensions and armed conflicts are on the rise worldwide. Violence and war remain the preferred means in the global struggle for power, raw materials or religious influence. National interests also shape the actions of the great powers. The independent guarantee of security remains crucial for our sovereignty in the small state of Switzerland. Within the framework of a serious security policy, a realistic threat picture must be determined on the basis of a realistic world view. A realistic assessment requires expecting surprises and imponderables. The protection of land and people does not tolerate half measures and compromises. Switzerland is vulnerable Our transit axes remain at the center of our strategic interests in light of the power struggle over resources and transport routes. Religiously motivated violence and terror - which have become visible with radical Islamism - occupy not only spaces but, via the Internet, also minds. There is an increased terrorist threat from non-state actors or possible cyber attacks. This has been impressively demonstrated by various events, also in Switzerland's immediate environment. Even if Switzerland is unlikely to become the main target of conceivable aggression, hostile actions and terrorist attacks are always possible. As a country with great prosperity, Europe's water castle, a hub for international commodity trading and an important financial center, Switzerland still has much to defend. Sufficient resources for a credible army The SVP wants a modernly equipped, well-trained defensive army that attacks no one but defends independence and shows Switzerland to be a predictable neutral state that contributes to peace. With the resources of 5 billion Swiss francs per year decided by the parliament with a stock of lOO'OOO members of the armed forces, the mission cannot be fulfilled, which includes not only defense but also the support of civilian authorities (e.g. in disaster relief). The hemorrhaging of the Army through further cuts in Army spending must be stopped. Spending on the armed forces decreased from 19 to 7.2 percent of the state budget since 1990. Compared with countries such as Sweden and Finland, Switzerland spent the least on the armed forces as a percentage of gross domestic product. From the SVP's point of view, funds of at least 5.4 billion francs per year and a target number of at least 140,000 army personnel are indispensable. A maximum number of service days per year should not be specified. The repetition course should usually last three weeks. Independent defense without alternative Guaranteeing the security of the country and its people is a core task of the state. That is why we need a strong and effective army with a concrete mission, binding goals and a reality-based strategy. In the 1990s, our armed forces fell into a worrying state as a result of useless reforms such as ""Army 95"", ""Army XXI"" and ""Development Step 08/11"" and became far removed from any operational readiness. When SVP Federal Councillor Ueli Maurer took office and targeted measures were taken to remedy the shortcomings, the trend was reversed. The army must again be able to fulfill its functions at all times. To this end, it must be able to be called up within a few days and be operational around the clock for a period to be defined. No foreign missions and military alliances The army has to leave the disastrous path of internationalization and has no business abroad. Foreign missions such as the one in Kosovo (KFOR mission) must be ended. Our army must neither be led into NATO nor integrated into the EU's common defense policy. In addition, trends toward further downsizing of the armed forces and creeping conversion into a professional army must be stopped. Management structures and bloated staffs must be further and noticeably streamlined. A powerful army also includes a well-equipped air force capable of countering threats in the air. It is therefore essential that the renewal of the air force be tackled in good time. STANDPOINTS The SVP is committed to an adequately armed and excellently trained militia army with a well-equipped ground force and air force to preserve an independent, free and neutral Switzerland; - calls for a target number of at least 140,000 army personnel with a budget of at least CHF 5.4 billion per year; - calls for a total renewal of the air force. The air patrol must be ensured around the clock. As an emergency solution during a transitional period, 2 to 3 Tiger F-5 squadrons should continue to be operated; - requires a high level of readiness of parts of the army or the entire army, graded according to the threat, and a corresponding mobilization organization; - calls for an end to armed foreign missions such as the one in Kosovo (KFOR mission); - stands for a non-aligned Switzerland and no further integration into NATO; - stands for the immediate abolition of the unlawful separation of training and operational responsibility; - calls for a balanced presence of the army in all regions; - is committed to preserving the Patrouille Suisse as a proud symbol of our armed forces' capabilities; - calls for an end to the marginalization and harassment of shooters, hunters and collectors of historical weapons and shooting in general. The SVP is committed to maintaining independent, liberal gun legislation. As a citizen, this brings me more security; as a family, the certainty that our country can be protected; as a member of the armed forces, the necessary resources to fulfill the mission for the country and its people; as a responsible member of the authorities, the right means to deal with crises and disasters at any time; as a parent, the certainty that my children will not have to go to foreign wars. Practice-oriented education instead of reform frenzy An efficient education system is the basis for Switzerland's development and prosperity. The focus is on the well-being of the child and his or her holistic development into a person responsible to him or herself and to others. The SVP supports a high-quality, efficient and performance-oriented education system. The school is to be consistently oriented towards practice by focusing on the promotion of head, heart and hand. Quality depends less on the use of public finances than on strong teacher personalities who are willing and free to lead. The dual education system must be preserved and strengthened at all costs. Stop out-of-touch reforms The education system must be aligned with the practice of the working world. If more doctors, engineers and technical professionals are needed, they should be trained in Switzerland. If entrepreneurs and secondary schools criticize the lack of basic knowledge among school leavers, elementary school must refocus on mathematics, the local language and natural sciences and dispense with two foreign languages in elementary school, ideological gender and sex education and anti-business ecology and consumer protection lessons. All the reform experiments of recent years - Bologna, HarmoS, Curriculum 21, integrative teaching, team teaching, competence orientation, etc. - have brought more bureaucracy, more centralism, academization and therapeutization instead of greater practical orientation and have led to a massive increase in the cost of the education system without any corresponding benefit. Performance orientation Affirming achievement must be part of the school day. Business and industry have to hold their own in the face of tough competition. They expect their employees to be motivated, willing and able to perform. The sovereignty of the cantons over the elementary school is a cornerstone of our education system. The cantonal curricula must specify clear and binding learning objectives. Performance and quality are to be demanded and promoted at every school level. Without order, discipline and the will to perform, there is no success. Performance evaluations shall be in the form of grades and behavioral assessments with written evaluations. The uniform report card must be simple and understandable for parents and teachers. Strengthening the teaching profession Teachers must be strengthened and provided with freedom of methods and teaching materials. There is a need to return to the proven classroom teacher system at the primary level. Teachers should spend their full energy and time on teaching and children, not on ""school development"", meetings and administration. The SVP is committed to the autonomy of local schools vis-à-vis the cantonal administrations. The people concerned should be able to determine their own school system. Strengthen vocational apprenticeships and technical professions More young people are to complete a practice-oriented vocational apprenticeship again. High baccalaureate rates are just signs of egalitarianism and leveling down. Vocational education is proven to be the best guarantor of low youth unemployment and ensures the necessary link between business and education. Our education system is designed to educate children and young people so that they can later find employment. However, the academization of recent decades has led precisely in the opposite direction. Many university graduates are unable to find jobs or, if they do find work, it is only in the state bureaucracy because there is too little demand for social scientists, humanities scholars and lawyers. On the other hand, training for technical professions, scientists, engineers, computer scientists or doctors, for which there is demonstrably a great demand in Switzerland, has been sorely neglected. Midwives, nurses, kindergarten teachers and primary school teachers should not have to complete a university education. Research for excellence Research is fundamentally not a core task of the state. However, the state should create favorable conditions for researchers. Research should not be an end in itself, but should be results- and application-oriented in competition with the best. Swiss universities and the ETHs must focus on imparting theoretical knowledge, on scientific work and on cutting-edge research. Study programs should be increasingly geared to the needs of the labor market. The SVP does not want mass universities, but top-class universities. No money for questionable programs It is repugnant when the Swiss taxpayer finances the education of thousands of foreign students who leave our country after graduation and use their education for the benefit of another business location. Therefore, much higher tuition fees must be charged for foreign students. Switzerland does not need another full association with the EU education programs, which cost billions, because it involves a lot of bureaucracy and wasteful idle time. Student exchange is also possible worldwide and directly between universities without expensive EU programs. STANDPOINTS The SVP advocates that education is fundamentally a matter for parents and training a matter for schools; demands that the cantons, and thus the citizens, be able to determine their school system directly and democratically; advocates that the elementary school should once again concentrate on the core subjects of the local language (German/French/Italian/Rhaeto-Romanic), mathematics and science; fights against the centralization and bureaucratization of schools through numerous reform experiments, HarmoS and Curriculum 21; is committed to the class teacher principle and demands that teachers be enabled by their training to lead a school class instead of coaching it; Demands discipline and order in the school classroom and on school grounds; demands grades starting in the first grade; demands a preference for the national languages when learning a first foreign language; demands that today's national anthem be retained and taught in public schools; demands more quality instead of quantity in higher education and, instead of too many social scientists and humanities scholars in Switzerland, more trained engineers, scientists and doctors; fights the further academization of education and rejects Maturltätsguoten; fights youth unemployment by strengthening practice-oriented vocational training; opposes the wasteful participation in EU education and research programs. As a pupil and student, this gives me a practical education and good opportunities in the labor market; as a parent, the certainty that my children are being prepared for the challenges of professional life at school; as a teacher, the opportunity to concentrate on imparting knowledge instead of being bogged down with administrative idle time; as an apprentice teacher, apprentices who come out of elementary school with a solid educational backpack; as a personnel manager, well-trained professionals from Switzerland. Safeguarding social services - combating abuses Since in the past the structural problems and the potential for abuse of the social security system were always covered up with tax revenues, it is all the more urgent today to restore the balance and solidarity between old and young, between the genuinely needy and the premium and tax payers. Responsible solutions need consistent policies. Problems covered with money Center-left policies have led to a failure to honestly address obvious abuses in social services, abuse and structural underfunding. People closed their eyes to the real problems. Grievances were usually casually covered up with more money - money that was collected from citizens and companies with additional taxes and levies. For example, VAT was increased by 1% for AHV in 1999 and by 0.4% for disability insurance (IV) in 2011. Further increases are already being planned. Pension provision in difficulties We are getting older and older and are therefore drawing pensions for longer and longer. The result is that fewer and fewer working people have to pay for more and more pensioners. Whereas in 1970 five people paid in for one pensioner, today the figure is three. By 2040, there will likely be only two. The AHV is already taking in less than it is paying out. The math no longer adds up. As in the case of the IV, additional funds for the AHV are to be siphoned off from the citizen in advance through a VAT increase instead of tackling promised and urgently needed reforms in the system. Welfare state reaches its limits The welfare state is increasingly reaching its limits. While social spending amounted to less than 2 billion francs in 1950 and rose to 62 billion francs by 1990, spending on social services in Switzerland already totaled 163 billion francs in 2012. The welfare state is growing over our heads, at the expense of future generations. Fewer and fewer people have to pay for more and more people. The welfare state as a whole is being called into question: Supplementary benefits, social assistance and health and accident insurance are financed by rising taxes and premiums, but AHV, unemployment insurance, occupational benefits, income replacement, disability insurance, maternity insurance and, as the last safety net, social assistance - none of these social institutions is solidly financed. For example, social welfare spending has doubled over the past 10 years to 2.4 billion francs. More and more people are receiving social assistance for longer and longer periods of time. Social assistance has lost its original function as a bridging aid and as a help for self-help. Centralization and professionalization tendencies have also led to systems becoming more and more distant from the people concerned, making it more difficult to provide effective and dignified assistance. This applies not only to social welfare, but also, for example, to child and adult protection, whose centralization in the form of the so-called KESB has led to a deterioration of the situation. Reforms unavoidable The SVP is committed to the long-term financial security of the social security system. It is aware that every franc that can be used for this purpose must first be earned. This requires that reforms be based on facts and realistic scenarios. That is why the SVP advocates the same retirement age of 65 for women as for men. In the case of occupational pensions, the SVP is in favor of depoliticizing technical parameters such as the minimum conversion rate or the minimum interest rate so that the actual situation is taken into account. Eliminate disincentives Furthermore, the reforms announced for the IV must be implemented. Certain nationalities (Balkan states, Turkey) have a higher than average incidence of IV recipients. The pension scale needs to be refined. The export of IV pensions abroad without purchasing power adjustment must be stopped. Better screening is needed for mental disorders that are now frequently diagnosed. Performance-restriction and performance-readiness tests must be the order of the day to prevent misuse and misdiagnosis. Social assistance must not be a hammock In the cantons, social assistance laws must be designed in such a way that social assistance can no longer be exploited and abused. Those who do not make an effort to integrate and work should not receive help. Work must be worthwhile again. The guidelines of the Swiss Conference for Social Welfare (SKOS) are to be regarded as recommendations or as non-binding guidance for the implementing bodies and are accordingly to be designated as such in the cantonal social assistance and welfare laws and ordinances. This is because the SKOS calculates ideologically motivated with too high rates. Those who refuse reasonable work or otherwise do not comply with the authorities' regulations should be able to have their benefits noticeably reduced. Further professionalization in the welfare sector must be vigorously opposed, and instead the militia principle, municipal autonomy and closeness to the citizen must be strengthened, as this is the only way to provide appropriate, favorable and at the same time dignified assistance for specific individual cases. STANDPOINTS is committed to the financial security of social services and rejects the expansion of the welfare state; rejects any increase in taxes and contributions, in particular an increase in value-added tax, for the restructuring of social services, because structural deficiencies must not be covered up with tax money; demands, in order to secure the AHV: equal retirement age of 65 for women and men; full use of the additional VAT percentage collected since 1999 for the AHV; repayment of the debts of the disability insurance to the AHV; moderate and gradual increase of the retirement age, adjusted to the constantly increasing life expectancy or the underfunding of the AHV reserve fund; advocates an overdue reorganization of the IV, as promised to the voters; fights for the renunciation of an overregulation of the occupational pension and the separation of the technical parameters from the BVG. At the very least, however, the conversion rate should be lowered; prefers family solutions to institutional solutions in child and adult protection; calls for a rethink in the social welfare system: The militia principle before professorial salaries. Municipal autonomy in the welfare sector must be strengthened; integration before social assistance. Social assistance is bridging assistance; the binding nature of the SKOS regulations must be removed from all cantonal social assistance laws; calls for the guarantee of a say for the municipalities in the area of child and adult protection and the rejection of professlonallization and centralization in the guardianship system; fights the unaffordable consequences of a wrong asylum policy in social assistance. This gives me, as a pensioner, secure pensions; as a young person, the prospect of still having secure social services in the future; as someone in need, the security of not being worse off because of abuses by others; as a consumer, no increase in value added tax for social services; as a community policeman, the possibility of being able to act according to need in every situation. Quality thanks to competition Our healthcare system is one of the best in the world, but also one of the most expensive. The increasing nationalization of health care is causing covetousness and premiums to rise continuously. Blatant disincentives in the current system must be eliminated. Personal responsibility must be strengthened. The paternalism of the citizen under the banner of health, which is becoming increasingly grotesque, must be stopped. Limits must be set on the rampant activities of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH). Overregulated healthcare sector A society that is living longer and longer and medical advances that are opening up more and more treatment options are factors that are leading to ever greater consumption of medical feistings. Coupled with mandatory insurance, it is clear that demand for healthcare services will remain high in the future. However, even more government intervention is the wrong medicine here. Regulations, bureaucracy and state interventionism are increasingly restricting individual responsibility and the development of an innovative private sector in the healthcare sector. Excessive benefits catalog Today, health insurance is no longer about an individual contract between the patient and his or her insurance company, but about a catalog of benefits set by the authorities. Instead of the doctor and the patient, the state determines which treatment is ""effective"", ""appropriate"" and ""economical"". In view of this excessive demand, politicians know nothing better than to constantly expand the benefits catalog with ever new, pleasing offers. But patients, doctors, the pharmaceutical industry and medical technology companies also want to include their wishes and services in the catalog. This overflowing coverage of every risk of illness and every individual need leads to a full coverage mentality on the part of the population, in which all personal responsibility is lost. Expensive prevention mania The nationalization of health care and the bureaucracy it has created have resulted in ever greater costs. From 2014 to 2018, according to the financial plan in the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), spending will grow by 418 million francs to a total of 3.1 billion francs. This is justified, among other things, by the general prevention activities of the FOPH. The health functionaries and self-appointed experts of the FOPH want to use laws and expensive campaigns to help society lead a supposedly good and healthy life. Tobacco and alcohol will be followed by laser, light and sound, and later probably sugar, lett or lle as targets of an actual prevention mania. More and more money is flowing into dubious and ideologically motivated studies and educational campaigns. Eliminate disincentives The SVP is fighting against further centralization and nationalization in the healthcare sector. Further state intervention, new laws, control bodies and central competencies at the federal level must be prevented, as they are already hindering competition and creating false incentives today. Instead of relying on the responsible citizen, the health apostles at the FOPH want to intervene in the health policy competencies of the cantons. This must not be allowed to happen. At the same time, the role of the cantons must be redefined and limited to essential tasks of supervision and control. The SVP therefore advocates a clear division of roles and a reduction of conflicts of interest. In this sense, the hospitals are to become independent, the tariff issues are to be negotiated by the tariff partners and, if necessary, approved by an independent judicial authority. Strengthen personal responsibility Competition and freedom of contract must also act as fundamental principles in the healthcare sector and must therefore be strengthened. The personal responsibility of the insured, i.e. also their cost sharing, must be increased and an exaggerated attitude of entitlement prevented. The personal relationship and the direct responsibilities derived from it between doctor and patient, between pharmacist and customer or also between insurance company and insured person must be in the foreground. The SVP therefore advocates the creation of a basic benefits catalog limited to the essential health needs in the compulsory insurance, which can be supplemented by freely selectable benefits financed by supplementary insurance. Asylum seekers and temporarily admitted persons must be treated outside the KVG system and directly at the expense of the federal government or the cantons. Stop academization of the nursing professions Today's nursing shortage is also the result of poor educational decisions. For the SVP it is not comprehensible how higher quality and quantity is to be achieved with an academization of the nursing professions. An academic title proves a theoretically oriented education, but says nothing at all about the quality for the benefit of the patients. In addition, the training of a local next generation of doctors should be promoted, among other things, by abolishing the nonsensical numerus clausus. STANDPOINTS The SVP stands for a competitive orientation of the health care system that guarantees high-quality health care for urban and rural areas; demands more transparency with regard to quality and prices in the health care system in order to strengthen the freedom of choice of patients and thus their well-being; demands a purging of the Lelstungskatalog In der Grundversicherung and the design of the Lelstungskatalog In Form einer Posltlvllste. Gender reassignment, cosmetic surgery, etc. must not be passed on to the general public; wants the immediate abolition of the officially fixed upper limit of the freely selectable deductible rate in the compulsory health insurance; advocates that palliative care as a holistic care concept for people with incurable, life-threatening or chronically progressive diseases be officially anchored in the health care system; opposes absurd and expensive self-satisfaction campaigns under the guise of prevention and relies on the personal responsibility of citizens; demands that people living illegally in Switzerland (Sans-Papiers and rejected asylum seekers) are no longer entitled to compulsory health insurance; demands that the academization of the nursing professions be reversed and that the nursing crisis in Switzerland be countered by more training places; rejects the legalization and trivialization of drugs. As a patient, this brings me high-quality care; as a family, affordable health insurance premiums; as a resident of a peripheral region, health care providers in the surrounding area; as a doctor, the free exercise of my profession without increasing state paternalism. For domestic production The SVP is committed to a productive agriculture that supplies the population with healthy food produced close to the market. Farm families must earn a reasonable living for their important services to the community. The planning security and innovative strength of an entrepreneurial agriculture must be strengthened. To this end, the excessive greening must be reduced to a reasonable level. The cultivated land must be taken care of in return. Farmer death continues One hundred years ago, there were still over 243,000 farms in Switzerland; in 1990, there were 108,000, and in 2013, there were just 55,000. The population supports the farming community and assigns it important tasks through the Federal Constitution and the Agriculture Act. This includes safeguarding and maintaining the basis of production and producing healthy, market-oriented food. However, due to the current agricultural policy, farmers are less and less able to fulfill the constitutional mandate: For example, a lot of agricultural land has been lost in recent years, and many farms have had to give up due to declining income. The preservation of the highest possible degree of self-sufficiency, as well as the management and maintenance of the cultivated landscape, are thus called into question. Self-sufficiency must not be allowed to decline further Switzerland is already one of the world's largest net importers of food per capita. While we import around 600 francs worth of food per inhabitant per year, this figure is around ten times lower in the EU. The net self-sufficiency rate (imported feed for domestic animal production deducted) was only 53 percent in 2014 (59% in 2000). Switzerland is thus far from being self-sufficient. In the SVP's view, therefore, production agriculture and thus family farms must be strengthened in a targeted manner. This also means moving away from area contributions to product-based direct payments such as anaupremiums for corn, wheat, potatoes and vegetables. Personal responsibility instead of a flood of regulations Unfortunately, our farmers are burdened by more and more regulations, forms and controls that make it more difficult for them to carry out their actual profession and also undermine their personal responsibility. Too much time has to be spent on paperwork and administration. Too much government money seeps into the agricultural bureaucracy instead of benefiting farmers. The farmer is a highly qualified food production specialist who should decide for himself what to produce, where and how. Producing agriculture Our production agriculture provides the most efficient and affordable means of maintaining a diverse and well-structured cultural landscape. This makes more ecological sense than transporting agricultural products across continents. With the current agricultural policy, however, Switzerland has taken exactly the opposite path, i.e. extensive agriculture is being promoted at the expense of production agriculture. So we are doing exactly what we should not be doing: First, we are importing more and more food of dubious origin, while second, we are also increasing our dependence on foreign countries. In addition, more and more valuable agricultural land is falling victim to forestation and the renaturation of water bodies. Also due to the high immigration, the settlement area is growing at the expense of cultivated land. Promotion of efficient farms Productive farms must not be financially disadvantaged compared to extensive farms. The SVP's goal is for Switzerland to return to a net self-sufficiency rate of at least 60 percent. However, this goal can only be achieved if the farming families are offered prospects for the future so that they invest sustainably in production. This also secures jobs in the upstream and downstream sectors (industry, commerce, tourism). Do not sacrifice agriculture on the altar of the EU The agricultural free trade agreement with the EU sought by the Federal Council as well as the agreement sought by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which envisage a much too far-reaching opening of borders in the area of agriculture, would have consequences that threaten the existence of farming families. Lowering food prices to EU or even world market price levels - while production costs remain the same - would destroy the existence of a domestic agricultural sector. This, in turn, would have a negative impact on decentralized settlement, maintenance of the cultural landscape, as well as food safety and quality. The SVP therefore rejects uncontrolled agricultural free trade with the EU and WTO. For existing imports of food products, the same requirements should be imposed on them as on those produced domestically. Sensible spatial planning The Spatial Planning Act must be geared towards enabling entrepreneurial farmers to develop their farms in a future- and market-oriented manner. The SVP is committed to ensuring that existing buildings outside the building zone can be used and converted fully and as flexibly as possible. This protects cultivated land, preserves the landscape and ensures added value in rural areas. The SVP stands for an economical use of agricultural land. STANDPOINTS The SVP wants to strengthen the producing farms and minimize the administrative requirements; demands the preservation of food security in Switzerland through a net self-sufficiency rate of at least 60 percent; fights for securing the livelihood of family farms and for an adequate agricultural income; relies on regional production, processing and marketing and rejects an agricultural free trade with the EU; advocates a spatial planning law that allows for a flexible and complete use of existing buildings and facilities outside the construction zone; opposes new directives and regulations in animal, water and environmental protection, which lead to higher costs and administrative complications; fights for investment security, in that buildings and facilities realized according to the latest knowledge and regulations do not have to be changed for at least 30 years; demands the same requirements for imported food as for domestic food; advocates targeted measures to promote livestock farming, livestock exports and the rearing of young livestock in order to strengthen productive grassland farms, especially in the wing and mountain regions; demands that Swiss agricultural products and wines be served in Swiss representations abroad as a matter of principle. This brings me as a consumer healthy food from local production; as a farming family perspectives for the future; as a farmer the necessary entrepreneurial freedom; as a hiker and tourist a cultivated cultural landscape; as a nature-loving person a beautiful and intact landscape. Free ride without harassment A needs-based, well-developed and maintained transport infrastructure is an important prerequisite for prosperity and free development. The scarce funds for infrastructure must be used efficiently and without ideology. The road must not be put at a disadvantage compared to the railways, as has often been the case in recent decades. Each mode of transportation should receive the funding it brings in. Redistribution, cross-subsidization and misappropriation must be stopped, as must the robbery of motorists through ever new and higher taxes, fees and fines. Transport network on the brink of collapse The enormous growth in traffic in recent decades has presented our infrastructure with major challenges. Bottlenecks are occurring in many places, especially on the roads - there is a threat of traffic gridlock. This is also reflected in the increase in congestion hours in recent years on the entire road network. However, the most congestion, obstructions and accidents occur on the main axes, as shown by the congestion levels on the national road network. Unilateral transport policy This situation is a consequence of the one-sided transport policy pursued by the Federal Council and Parliament in recent decades, but also of economic growth, increasing mobility and high immigration. Optimizing traffic flows by means of traffic management measures (use of breakdown lanes, temporary speed reductions, temporary truck overtaking bans) can alleviate the problems, but in view of the enormously high forecast growth rates, an expansion of the road infrastructure is imperative. Eliminate bottlenecks The overriding goal must be to remove the most important bottlenecks immediately with the available funds and to carry out expansions on the entire network. Road and rail must be treated equally. There must be no financial discrimination against individual modes of transport in favor of others. The only criterion that applies is the economic viability and the demand of transport users. Previous structures serve to rip off The most important principle of a new and functioning transport policy is the consistent elimination of disincentives and disadvantages. Today, for example, there are systematic delays in the planning and expansion of infrastructure. Moreover, the financing mechanisms are one-sided and non-transparent. This is particularly evident in the area of road geiders at the federal level. Today, the road receives just under one-third of the money delivered from its sector via levies and taxes. Bus terror at the expense of motorists So it's no wonder that the expansion of the road infrastructure is stalling, but it's also no wonder that drivers rightly see themselves as financial milk cows as a result. In addition, motorists are being ripped off by an inflationary system of fines. The supposedly increased safety of road users turns out to be a cheap excuse in view of the firmly budgeted revenue from fines. The development over the years shows a steady increase in these revenues - an actual bus terror at the expense of motorists. As if this were not enough, further projects are planned in the administration for even more levies and charges on road traffic: Tunnel tolls, mobility pricing, higher fuel taxes, etc. This robbery must finally be stopped. Transport policy without chicanery The solution of the traffic problems requires a reorganization of the traffic policy. In this context, the optimal use of means of transport, efficiency and cost-effectiveness have to be in the foreground. This means that the financing structures that have grown over the years, with misappropriation and cross-subsidization, will finally be broken up and replaced by transparent and ideology-free instruments. Overall, the free choice of transport must continue to be fully guaranteed for citizens - i.e. without false incentives. The principles of such a transport policy can be summarized as follows:Each means of transport gets the funds it generates (through the previous taxes, charges, etc.). This principle effectively puts a stop to misappropriation and cross-subsidization. Any increase in existing levies and the introduction of new levies shall be subject to an optional referendum. The accounting of the individual modes of transport must be placed on a transparent and comprehensible basis. The self-sufficiency of the modes of transport must be improved. The aim must be for the modes of transport to be able to finance themselves without government subsidies in the medium term. Efficient expansion The introduction of such a model leads to the following improvements compared to the current system: The expansion of future transport infrastructure is based on the principle of economic efficiency. Each project is measured against demand and the relationship between costs and benefits. This also includes future operating costs, which are massively underestimated today. The inclusion of economic efficiency inevitably leads to a prioritization of future projects. This approach has the advantage that the people are not constantly promised new projects that have to be postponed or abandoned altogether in view of the tight finances. It is therefore not a matter of playing off the individual modes of transport against each other, but rather of finding the ideal combination and use of the existing network. The policy of the last decades, with one-sided promotion of rail transport and simultaneous burdening of the other modes of transport, must therefore be stopped. In the opinion of the SVP, all modes of transport should be used according to their respective strengths. In this way, they contribute to the free development of citizens and the preservation of prosperity. STANDPOINTS The SVP fights any discrimination against modes of transport and is in favor of the free choice of transport; demands a stop to the cross-subsidization of rail by fees and charges on road transport; opposes bus terror, where the focus is not on the safety of citizens but on revenue for the state; demands the abolition of the Via sicura regulations; categorically rejects higher or new fees and charges in individual transport and therefore says no to tunnel fees at the Gotthard and to mobility pricing; opposes politically motivated increases in gasoline prices and ever new tin police officers who only serve to rip off citizens; supports the accelerated completion of the national road network with the elimination of bottlenecks as well as the construction of a second road tube at the Gotthard; demands a higher degree of cost recovery in rail transport, combined with a moderate increase in ticket prices; wants transparency in the construction and follow-up costs of infrastructure projects by including economic efficiency as the primary criterion; advocates an improvement in the framework conditions for aviation through sensible and business-friendly measures and contracts as well as a reduction in requirements and regulations; calls for a fund only for road transport at constitutional level, analogous to FABI (financing and expansion of rail infrastructure); calls for the completion of the expansion of the Lötschberg tunnel (second tube). For me as a car driver, this means more safety, less congestion and no new taxes and charges; for me as a train driver, fewer overcrowded trains; for me as a transporter, sufficient capacity on road and rail and the guarantee that my products will reach my customers on time; for me as an employee of an international company, reliable connections all over the world. For a secure and affordable energy supply Nothing works without energy. To this day, Switzerland has a functioning, secure and inexpensive energy supply with strong domestic electricity production. Taxes and fees as well as regulations are of a tolerable level. The federal government's Energy Strategy 2050 aims to abandon this safe and proven path for a nebulous vision without a secure foundation. But there is too much at stake for any ideology-driven experiments. As a country poor in raw materials, Switzerland is dependent on secure and cheap energy. The demand for energy is rising and rising Energy consumption in our country is rising steadily despite efforts to save and improve efficiency. This will continue in the future, because in addition to population growth, economic growth and prosperity in particular ensure that our energy requirements remain at a high level. Further improvements in convenience and more and more new applications (in communications, in the home, etc.) ensure that this development will continue. Energy becomes more expensive Rising energy prices are poison for the economy and prosperity. They ensure that the production costs of the economy increase, competitiveness decreases and the population has less money in their wallets. Instead of reducing the burdens to a minimum, however, energy sources are now being misused as a welcome source of tax revenue. Fees and charges are increased or new ones created. This approach is usually justified by ecological goals or, more recently, by the phase-out of nuclear energy. However, these goals can be achieved with the selected measures at best in theory and associated with immense costs. Massive redistribution The billions in levies flow largely into the federal budget. Another part is redistributed to other energy sources with little success. With the energy strategy of the federal government this wrong way is still extended, with notabene smaller production than up to now. At the same time, it is extremely questionable whether the desired ecological goals can be achieved. Fewer taxes and fees and improved framework conditions for private individuals and entrepreneurs should be the motto. In the interests of investment and legal certainty, the existing financing instruments must be reviewed and questioned. Energy policy must be guided by the principles of demand, economic efficiency, independence and environmental friendliness. Security of supply as the primary objective The ultimate goal of a sensible energy policy is cheap, independent, abundant and environmentally friendly energy. This principle is adhered to with the current energy mix. The fossil share of the overall system must be reduced in order to strengthen independence. But this requires electricity that is available at all times and in all weather conditions. Apart from fossil fuels, only hydropower and nuclear power can meet these requirements. However, these two main pillars of our power supply are under severe political pressure. The planned phase-out of nuclear power would eliminate an average of 40 percent of our electricity production. Hydroelectric power, which accounts for around 55 percent of the total, is also in danger due to highly subsidized wind and solar power both at home and abroad. Investments in these energy sources are delayed or not made at all because of the uncertain situation. Only small contribution from renewables The new renewable energies such as wind and solar, which are much praised by the media and center-left parties, are far from being able to make up for this shortfall. On the contrary, their share of the electricity mix is shockingly low, despite billions in subsidies. Today, renewable energies such as wind and solar power account for only a tiny 0.6 percent of Switzerland's total electricity production. How this small share will make up for nuclear energy is completely unclear today. Switzerland's security of supply and thus its economic strength and prosperity are being put at risk with gross negligence. No to the system change - No to the Energy Strategy 2050 The above points show one thing clearly: the Federal Council's Energy Strategy 2050 does not meet the requirements for supplying our country with cheap and secure energy. Instead of realistic assumptions and measures, ideological and utopian wishful thinking as well as governmental and regulatory interventions dominate. Combined with the increase of existing taxes and fees and the creation of new taxes, this results in an energy policy that permanently harms our country. The SVP's strategy is different: Instead of a politically motivated deterioration of the framework conditions of individual energy sources, their equal treatment is needed. Instead of new levies and fees, we need the reduction of such burdens. Instead of more government regulation, subsidization and steering, regulations need to be dismantled. STANDPOINTS The SVP fights the federal government's economically damaging and interventionist Energy Strategy 2050; demands that energy supply be based on the principles of demand, economic viability, independence, environmental friendliness and low immissions; categorically rejects new or higher levies and charges that make energy more expensive; opposes government incentive and subsidy taxes as well as further regulations and rules in the energy sector that harm industry and peripheral regions in particular; supports the expansion of domestic electricity production, especially hydroelectric power; opposes technology bans; supports the retention of the current proven electricity mix and firmly rejects a politically motivated shutdown of existing nuclear power plants and a deterioration of the framework conditions for energy sources; welcomes private research and realization of projects in the field of new renewable energies such as geothermal, wind and solar energy and biomass. This brings me as a consumer enough energy at any time and at a favorable price; as an entrepreneur a secure and affordable energy supply with high planning security; as an environmentally conscious citizen a low-pollution and independent energy production; as a home owner no new regulations, bans and constraints; as a resident of a peripheral region jobs nearby; as a citizen more independence from foreign countries and international prices as well as fewer blackmail possibilities against Switzerland. Intact environment for us and our descendants Our lives are shaped by the environment. A healthy environment forms an indispensable basis for well-being and quality of life today and in the future. The SVP is strongly rooted in nature from its rural origins. The environment must be taken care of. To this end, a holistic, practical and citizen-oriented policy must be pursued that is not guided by green fundamentalism and state coercion. Moderation is also good advice here. Excellent situation Our environment is doing well. Since the beginning of industrialization, the level of pollutants and emissions has never been as low as it is today, and our rivers and lakes have never been as clean. Through the continuous application of the knowledge gained from science and technology, we succeeded in making the once acidic soil and polluted air clean again. Despite a massive increase in population due to immigration (+1.4 million people) and 34 percent more vehicles since 1990, more economic output and prosperity, Switzerland has not only been able to meet its international environmental commitments, it is also one of the industrialized countries with the lowest per capita emissions of pollutants despite poor geographic and climatic conditions. We owe this development in particular to scientific progress and voluntary measures by the industry. Practice before unworldly theory These facts are all too readily ignored or denied by green ideologues and environmental theorists. The aim is to give people a guilty conscience by constantly painting a black picture. This is to pave the way for the implementation of their policy of educational measures, state coercion, rampant prohibitions, rip-offs and imposed joylessness. Stop the regulation and prohibition mania Switzerland already has a dense network of environmental laws and regulations. Additional regulations and bans do nothing for the environment; on the contrary, they actually weaken it. After all, only a country with a high level of prosperity and a healthy economy has the means at all to implement the application of new technologies and thus achieve improvements for the environment. In spatial planning, federalism must be upheld again and the cantons must be given back the leeway for a policy that is close to the people and practical. No new levies and fees Overregulation also creates financial disadvantages. Over the years, in the name of environmental protection, new charges and fees have been introduced or increases in existing ones have been implemented. Today, the population already pays a good 10.5 billion Swiss francs annually for environmental taxes and fees. This corresponds to 6.3 percent of the total revenue from federal, cantonal and municipal taxes and social contributions. Thus, levies on fuel and heating oil as well as on waste, water or electricity, but also recycling fees are a direct consequence of government regulation. Other fees or increases in these areas are being planned or are being considered by Parliament, although often completely unfounded. As an example, Switzerland is already the recycling world champion thanks to a well-functioning system of private and public waste disposal companies. There is no need for new, government-imposed deposit and fee systems. Sensible, implementable solutions for our descendants Our good environmental situation is due to the fact that the economy and the population apply the knowledge of technical progress on their own initiative and live accordingly. This has resulted in many private initiatives, innovations, products, companies and even job descriptions. This has had more impact than government coercion, threats of punishment or bans. On the contrary, these lead to the loss of wealth and jobs. Nor do we need new laws, regulations and thus more bureaucracy, but rather the consistent enforcement of existing law. And finally, there is no need for unilateral targets or Swiss solo runs - after all, emissions and pollutants do not stop at national borders - but rather international efforts and resolutions, provided that these are supported and implemented by all states. Acting Together - Without Dunning Finger In addition, reference should also be made to the principle of voluntariness. This has ensured that Switzerland has even been able to improve its position in terms of environmental quality. Industry and commerce as well as private individuals have ensured that our country recognizes problems at an early stage and solves them creatively, because it is economically worthwhile to carry out projects without subsidies, new taxes or fees. We must not leave the field in the environmental sector to the doomsayers, theorists and green ideologues. Environmental practitioners in industry, commerce and agriculture are guarantors of an environment worth living in. STANDPOINTS The SVP supports sensible efforts to preserve, restore and improve the natural foundations of life; relies on the constantly new findings and achievements of science, technology and industry to tackle environmental problems; stands for appropriate measures in the field of spatial planning, water protection, air pollution control and an independent, economic and environmentally friendly energy policy; opposes environmental hysteria and scaremongering by the media, politicians, political parties, organizations or international bodies, and rejects demands or measures arising therefrom; supports not theoreticians but genuine environmental practitioners, for example in agriculture and forestry, recyclers and tradesmen; Opposes the creation of subsidized ""nature parks"" and further government intervention with bureaucratic requirements for farmers, businesses and tourism; demands that any unjustified opposition to major construction and infrastructure projects be fully compensated and that the right of associations to complain be restricted; Calls for a revision of the Spatial Planning Act that is oriented towards the spirit of federalism in order to return authority over spatial planning to the cantons; firmly rejects unilateral environmental and climate policy goals without internationally binding resolutions by all states; opposes any new or increases in existing levies and fees in the area of environmental and climate policy. This brings me, as a citizen, less ideology and scaremongering; as a family, an intact and clean environment, also for our children and grandchildren; as an investor, more planning security and less bureaucracy in projects; as a businessman and farmer, fewer requirements and more opportunities in my entrepreneurial activities. More diversity, less state Independent, free media (press, radio, television, Internet, social media) as well as competition between individual media providers are guarantors of a vibrant and functioning democracy. State influence as well as excessive regulation are poison for freedom and diversity of opinion and lead to a monopoly. More competition, a narrow definition of public service, more transparency and fewer legal fetters for private providers characterize a liberal media policy. State support and subsidies make dependent The media landscape is constantly changing, and with it the habits of media consumers. Increasingly popular free offerings in print and on the Internet are not only creating more variety and competition, but are also squeezing traditional media products. One can regret this development or, like left-wing intellectuals, even demonize it - but it is a fact. Generous subsidies and support measures do nothing to change this situation; on the contrary, they lead to greater dependence on the state and thus ultimately even to a reduction in media diversity, since many providers, true to the motto ""What bread I eat, that song I sing,"" pass on the message of their ""patron"" unfiltered and uncritically, thus becoming a state media organ. Misuse of the term ""public service However, this development can be observed not only in the print sector with its outdated press subsidies, but also in the television and radio sector. The quasi-monopolist SRG has virtually no competition there due to various legal revisions. Over 92 percent of the fee money goes to SRG. The Swiss pay what are probably the highest radio and television fees in the world. In view of this market power, it is not surprising that SRG has spent its lavishly bubbling funds well for its own purposes over the years. Radio and television were massively expanded under the vague umbrella term ""public service. Every niche was filled with a special-interest program, and every target group, no matter how small, was catered for. SRG now owns 17 radio stations, 7 television stations and various websites - no other state provider in a similarly large country in Europe has more programs. Even against the background of multilingualism and its challenges, this abundance cannot be explained. Now SRG wants to expand even further on the Internet. 3 x more expensive The costs of the overpriced SRG state broadcaster have tripled since 1984! While the SRG budget has more than tripled, less and less remains in the citizen's wallet. In the future we will even pay 1000 francs Billag media tax per year and household! For more freedom and independence in the media sector A diverse and independent media landscape is central to a functioning democracy. The laws and regulations that have so far been strongly tailored to the SRG must be broken up and redesigned for the future. However, the path must not lead to additional fees for private providers and further dependence on the state. Instead, the goal must be to achieve a massive improvement in the current framework conditions for private providers. Among other things, this means that radio and television stations without license fee money will be immediately freed from state control and bureaucracy. Furthermore, state media subsidy measures should be abolished and not expanded. The misuse of the term public service, which has been practiced for years, must be remedied. A narrow definition is intended to ensure a basic offering, namely in the information sector, leaving the remaining programs or topics to the free market. Dual system is the best solution In the area of fees, the current system needs to be fundamentally changed. Radio and television fees must be massively reduced. The practice whereby public broadcasters receive both fees and advertising money must be abolished and replaced by a so-called ""dual system"". In practice, this means that public broadcasters should continue to receive license fee money, but they should no longer be allowed to advertise. This is reserved for private providers, who in return are not to receive any fee money. The division of fees for the state broadcasters and advertising for the private broadcasters is not only reasonable, but also fair, as it avoids a too one-sided and monopolistic position of one of the two groups. This leads to greater competition between state and private providers and, for the consumer, to higher quality, more choice and better programs. More transparency, more freedom and fewer fees The creation of transparency in SRG's accounts is also long overdue. The expenditure items of the state broadcaster must all be disclosed - after all, the population has a right to know what their broadcasting fees are spent on. The same transparency should be standard for all government or government-related institutions anyway. Copyright companies such as SUISA, Pro Litteris and other companies active in this area, such as Billag, which have received too much in the past or should not have been allowed to demand any money at all due to a lack of legal status, should also be required to disclose their accounts in full and thus improve control. The higher transparency also has another positive effect: it lowers costs. This and the restriction of the basic offering to the information sector on radio and television could massively reduce state media levies. All of this would be done without sacrificing subject matter, without sacrificing quality, with more freedom and less government influence - for an independent, vibrant and strong democracy. STANDPOINTS The SVP rejects state media funding and further expansion of the SRG - particularly in the Internet sector; wants to strengthen private media providers: private radio and television stations without license fees must be freed from state control and bureaucracy immediately; supports the dual system (fees for public broadcasters, advertising for private broadcasters) and rejects a state media tax; requires a narrow definition of the public service in radio and television. This is intended to ensure a basic service, particularly in the area of information in the four national languages; demands that television programs financed by fees be produced in Switzerland and that the fee money be invested in Switzerland; demands a massive reduction in reception fees, a departure from the splitting model (distribution of fees to SRG and private broadcasters) and the setting of fees by parliament; demands comprehensive transparency and disclosure of SRG's accounts, broken down by broadcaster, division, administration, events, marketing, lobbying, etc; supports a ban on SRG opinion polls on elections and votes; rejects advertising bans. All products that are legally available should be allowed to be advertised. This gives me, as a consumer, more choice and better programs at lower fees; as a responsible citizen, less state paternalism and influence; as a media creator, less influence by the state, more freedom and independence; as an entrepreneur, reasonable advertising opportunities for my products at better conditions. Good for body and mind Like few other areas of life, sporting activity stands for joy, performance and fairness. Sporting activities provide people with physical and mental well-being and strengthen their willingness to perform. The SVP supports amateur, school, youth and disabled sports and, in particular, voluntary, honorary work in sports clubs as well as competitive sports activities. The framework conditions for sports clubs must be improved, for example, through unbureaucratic, cost-effective options for using public infrastructures. Meaningful, healthy leisure activities The sporting activity allows young and old a meaningful, healthy leisure time. While the left complains about the lack of integration of foreign youths, numerous SVP members and sympathizers are actively engaged as coaches and club managers in individual and team sports precisely for their integration. In clubs and associations, young people learn at an early age to assume responsibility and leadership functions and to succeed as part of a team. Sport is a meaningful leisure activity and a valuable school for life; it promotes the will to perform and persevere and gets some young people off the streets. This reduces their risk of slipping into drug addiction or even crime. Sport as a subject Qualified sports lessons under the guidance of qualified teachers are designed to give children and young people the fun of endurance, exercise and play. School sports offer a change from sedentary, top-heavy school lessons, while popular or competitive sports provide a balance to everyday working life. Apart from schooling and infrastructures, sport is not a primary state responsibility. Top-level sport motivates grassroots sport Top performances by top and competitive athletes motivate young people and broad sections of the population to take part in sports. Athletic talent is to be fostered through a training program that combines school and/or vocational training with professional athletic training. The SVP is committed to fairness and fights match fixing, doping and violence. STANDPOINTS The SVP supports sporting activity to promote enjoyment, performance and fairness; recognizes sport as an important opportunity to take on responsibility in clubs and associations at an early age; supports school sports as an important physical balance to the top-heavy education; is committed to elite and competitive sport and its role model effect for young people and the general public; calls for the unbureaucratic and cost-effective use of existing public infrastructures (sports grounds, facilities, etc.) for the important work of sports clubs; stands for fairness and combats doping, betting fraud and violence in and around the stadiums; recognizes the integrative performance of sport in clubs and associations. As a recreational athlete, this gives me the opportunity to participate in sports with the necessary infrastructure; as a top and competitive athlete, it gives me professional training and support; as an employee of a club or association, it gives me the opportunity to actively promote the interests of sports; as a parent, it gives me the certainty that my children are being supported in sports at school or in clubs and are not hanging around on the streets. Culture is a matter of culture Culture is the multifaceted expression of a diverse society. The drive for cultural activities has always come from people. Culture is thus first and foremost an expression of private initiative. State-sponsored culture always runs the risk of paying homage to the zeitgeist and the personal preferences of cultural bureaucrats instead of creating values that are valid for longer and go beyond the topicality of the day. State cultural policy may therefore at most supplement private offerings and should be structured on a federal basis. No imposed state culture The more the state culture grows, the more the lived folk culture is lost. Government cultural policies often lead policymakers to support whatever culture suits them best politically. This increases the risk of favoritism and mousehandling. Or else cultural policy becomes promotion with the watering can. Either way, culture is a matter of taste. The state has hardly lost anything here. More money - More dependence The new cultural message, which sets out the guidelines for the federal government's cultural policy between 2016 and 2019, indicates the centralist and statist direction in which the federal government's promotion of culture should continue to move. Federal spending is expected to grow to more than 1 billion francs. This growth fosters covetousness and demands on the state, creating dependencies, when cultural workers should be independent, driven by their own initiative and passion, living a culture of diversity. The federal government is now even striving for a ""national cultural policy"". He also wants to coordinate the content of municipal and cantonal cultural policy and give ""contours"" to the funding policy of all levels. However, this means constant standardization and centralized influence on federal cultural funding. Against EU cultural bureaucracy The federal government's cultural bureaucrats are now even striving to join the EU's bureaucratic monster ""Creative Europe"". This program is a multi-billion dollar prestige project of the Brussels bureaucracy. This will provide financial support to 250,000 cultural professionals, 2,000 cinemas, 800 films and 4,500 book translations across Europe. This centralized funding policy is the height of state culture. The citizen is ultimately asked to pay for these desires, but is unlikely to benefit from additional cultural offerings. The cultural bureaucracy has long since become independent. She is no longer dependent on an audience. Individual initiative creates culture In the SVP's view, culture is fundamentally not a matter for the federal government, the cantons or the municipalities. Culture is the business of culture. The state should only have a subsidiary effect vis-à-vis individual initiative and private support. Public support of one project always means discrimination against all non-supported projects. Therefore, the SVP fights on the one hand against the expanding cultural bureaucracy and on the other hand against the one-sided politically driven promotion within the framework of today's cultural policy. Lived culture means diversity By culture we mean, in general terms, what people produce through their actions. Culture requires nurturing for its preservation. It is precisely the liberal, federalist state that should aim to create an intellectual climate that enables cultural diversity. Unfortunately, current cultural policy is doing the opposite. Cultural policy must not strive for uniformity, but must allow for diversity. A cultural policy in Switzerland has to correspond to the federalist, decentralized structures of our country. If anything, the cantons and the municipalities, not the federal government, are responsible for promoting culture. Honor private initiative Instead, private patronage or sponsorship are better suited to enable diverse developments. Diversity, competition, initiative and passion are the values on which the culture lives. Culture definitely also has to do with the market economy and the laws of supply and demand. The competition of ideas should also play out in culture. A production that bypasses the audience makes no sense. The culture that pleases the public should be commercially successful. State culture distorts this competition and promotes politically and ideologically motivated projects. Thus, today our folk culture is hardly supported by the state. It thrives on the voluntary commitment and contribution of individuals, associations or foundations. Culture creates togetherness There, willingness to perform and joy are generally considered to be elements that belong together, i.e. exactly what society needs today. Amateur theater, amateur orchestras, singing societies, music associations, yodeling clubs, traditional costume groups, and even Guggenmusik and rock bands: they all strive less for the praise of art critics than for what culture essentially is, namely the need to create something together with heart and soul that gives pleasure to oneself and the audience. This form of culture also needs no subsidies, but all the more recognition and a fair starting position. This is also the core of our militia culture. It is not without reason that Switzerland's associations, which are almost unique in the world, are regarded as schools of democracy thanks to personal and community responsibility under democratic participation. This needs to be supported. STANDPOINTS The SVP demands strict adherence to the principle of subsidiarity in cultural policy, because the federal government may only act in addition to the municipalities and cantons; wants cultural policy at the federal level to be strictly limited to its core tasks; advocates that the misguided cultural bureaucracy, which is spread across several departments, be streamlined in accordance with the constitutional mandate. The potential savings of half a billion francs of taxpayers' money per year for cultural promotion, some of which is questionable, should be exploited; calls for an end to cultural funding according to the Glesskannenprlnzlp; rejects further centralization of cultural policy within the framework of a ""national cultural policy""; calls for the targeted promotion and massive tax relief or tax exemption of private cultural foundations and donations as well as legal facilitation for the establishment of foundations; stands for folk culture in associations and private structures that are not dependent on the state, but create local and national culture by citizens for citizens on their own initiative and responsibility; demands that local traditional culture is given preference over international and prestigious cultural projects that are distant from the people; defends itself against participation in EU cultural programs that is wasteful of money and distant from citizens and the economy. This gives me, as a person interested in culture, a diverse rather than simple offering; as a creative person, more freedom and protection from state influence and monopolization; as a folk musician or amateur performer, an equal footing in cultural competition. Stand by our values The SVP is committed to Switzerland's Christian occidental culture. This is the basis of our identity and our coexistence. It is not without reason that our country bears a cross in its coat of arms, and our national anthem is in the form of a prayer Freedom of faith and conscience allows all citizens to think, write, speak - and confess freely. Cultivating your own roots The separation of church and state is not intended to conceal the fact that an image of society and man shaped by the Christian faith is of great importance for Switzerland's culture and politics. The loss of these roots would be devastating. It is precisely individual freedom that is a consequence of the Christian conception of man. The development of democracy from ancient ideas can only be understood with the transition to self-responsibility. Furthermore, the Protestant work ethic is the basis of an entrepreneurial and also performance-oriented society. We draw rational thinking, creativity and innovation from the Christian occidental foundations. Because entrepreneurship and progress are rooted in active openness to a prosperous future. But also the Catholic idea of subsidiarity and the emphasis on the value of the individual within creation were and are formative for Switzerland and Swiss federalism. Problems should be solved independently and, if possible, by the people concerned. Respect legal order Tolerance and openness are also part of the Christian heritage. However, this should not prevent us from critically monitoring certain developments. Today, there is a thought taboo to take a more precise and also differentiated critical look at Islam. Well over 400,000 members of the Muslim faith live in Switzerland. Certainly, only a small minority sympathizes with Islamist extremist ideas. But Muslim immigrants often come from countries where there is no democratic legal system. They bring with them ideas about law and order that are incompatible with our legal system and our democratic rules of the game. Radicalization and isolationist tendencies are a problem that should not be underestimated. There are also people and groups in our country who sympathize with radical Islam. At the same time, demands are being made by Islamic communities to be recognized as public corporations or to have their clergy trained at our universities. These ffer demands as well as the demand for special legal treatment must not be met uncritically and naively. Uphold freedom of faith and conscience Our roots, not only spiritual but also historical and cultural, must be preserved and nurtured. The task of the churches is to offer people support and real help in life through proclamation and pastoral care. The churches thus make an essential contribution to a social Switzerland. Neither a party nor the state should commit people to religious beliefs or prescribe the ""right"" faith for them. Our freedom of faith and conscience allows all residents to think, write, speak - and profess - freely. Churches and religious communities therefore enjoy freedom of proclamation and freedom for church activities within the framework of the constitution. However, this tolerance finds its limits where religious communities despise or even fight tolerance. Insist on rules Just as we as guests in Islamic states adapt to the rules there, we must consistently insist on compliance with our law here. Parallel societies with their own legal system cannot be tolerated. Our liberal legal system must not bow to Sharia under any circumstances; our courts must not accept an Islamic ""cultural background"" in mitigation of punishment under any circumstances. Tolerating or even promoting practices such as forced marriage, ""honor killing,"" blood feuds, female circumcision, underage marriage, or polygamy is absolutely unacceptable in this country. Our constitutional state has the duty to demand integral respect for our legal system, even from immigrants, and to avoid granting any concession, no matter how seemingly minor. No parallel societies The legal system must take appropriate measures to ensure that the problem of Islamism, for example, does not worsen. It must be made clear that our rules apply to all members of religious communities and that everyone who wants to live here must adapt. Equality before the law always applies. This is why, for example, dispensations from swimming lessons, refraining from singing Christmas carols in kindergarten or special requests in funeral services are not permissible. Anyone who does not unconditionally support our free democratic fundamental rights must not be naturalized. STANDPOINTS The SVP stands by the Christian occidental foundation of our state, our legal system and our culture; demands that, for example, crosses as symbols of our Christian occidental culture and our religion be respected and tolerated in the public sphere; rejects any religiously motivated special law that contradicts our legal system; demands a ban on veiling in public service activities, for example in the health service, the police, at public counters or in teaching professions; rejects any claim to special burial rules in public cemeteries; opposes special holiday regulations for non-recognized religious communities; wants all pupils to attend compulsory school subjects, including sports and swimming lessons; demands the unconditional enforcement of the ban on minarets passed by the people; wants Swiss citizens who have been active abroad as terrorists or jihadists to be severely punished on their return to Switzerland; demands that foreigners or Swiss dual citizens who are active as terrorists or jihadists lose their residence status or Swiss citizenship immediately.Swiss citizenship immediately and be expelled; rejects the recognition of non-Western religious communities as public-law entities and the state training of clerics of these religious communities. As a believer, this gives me the freedom to practice my faith; as a parent, it gives me the certainty that my children can be guided by Christian occidental values in school as well; as a teacher, it gives me clarity about my students' attendance of classes; as a citizen, it gives me protection from violence and public incitement to hatred. Individual responsibility instead of paternalism The SVP supports the pursuit of happiness and contentment by every human being. Individual decisions must be made on the basis of personal responsibility; it must not be the state that ultimately decides on the success or failure of private life plans. The family must continue to play its role as a supporting pillar of society in the future. To do this, it needs a great deal of freedom and as little state intervention as possible. No nationalization of the family The state increasingly intervenes in family formation by favoring certain family forms. For example, government subsidies and tax breaks for daycare discriminate against the traditional family. The state also intervenes where society functions without problems and pays, for example, to daycare centers for parents who do not need it financially. The suspicion is that these measures are intended to help change society. The state is interfering more and more in the education of children instead of limiting itself to its educational mandate. School is abused Schools are often called upon to solve problems due to alleged grievances, whether in the area of sex education, in dealing with media and consumption, or in ""political education"". A liberal understanding assumes that parents are responsible for the upbringing of their children. Egalitarianism The planned reforms of marriage and family law lead to arbitrariness and non-bindingness. Marriage between a man and a woman is to be weakened by making all possible forms of cohabitation equal to it. For example, the equality of polygamy (polygamous marriages) is being discussed. The same-sex partnership, which is already recognized and legally equivalent to marriage, is to be considered marriage. Furthermore, mechanisms are to be put in place so that the cohabitation of adults with children automatically acquires family status after a certain period of time. This opens the door to abuse and arbitrariness. Problems with inheritance law, social security, divorce law, alimony or tax law are pre-programmed. Such reforms do not lead to a liberal society, but to a nationalization of private life. They threaten important social cells such as the family, associations, foundations, churches, neighborhoods, and village and neighborhood communities that exist independently of the state. Free expression of opinion without muzzle The racism penal norm, narrowly accepted by the people in 1994, must be abolished. The ever-expanding court practice shows the absurdity of this penal norm. Resorting to criminal law to condemn opinions or intimidate those who hold them is deeply undemocratic. Strengthen families The family, and with it marriage between a man and a woman, is the foundation of our society. Parents and children deserve the special protection of the state. Parents or single parents bear the responsibility for the upbringing and development of their children and give them love and security. In the process, the child learns help and consideration, as well as the ability to deal with conflicts. More appreciation for volunteer work Valuable work is done not only in the paid workplace, but also day after day in the private sphere, whether in the form of helping neighbors, caring for relatives or looking after children. This work is increasingly devalued and marginalized with the buzzword professionalization. State institutions such as crèches or lunch counters cannot replace parental love and care. The upbringing of children is the responsibility of the parents from their birth until they reach the age of majority and cannot be delegated to the state. In addition to good professional development, training and continuing education opportunities, it is also important for our young people to have an environment that shows them appreciation and in which they can develop their personalities. The SVP therefore also supports clubs and youth associations as important providers of a meaningful way of life and leisure and appreciates voluntary work. No battle between the sexes Men and women should complement each other. It is not gender, but only aptitude that should determine who holds which functions or office. Equal rights and equal pay for equal work and performance for men and women are a matter of course for the SVP. Neither state equality offices nor other bureaucratic regulations such as wage police or quotas serve this goal. The SVP is opposed to egalitarianism and is committed to the independent partnership of men and women in family, society, work and politics. STANDPOINTS The SVP advocates personal responsibility and self-determination for families and opposes the increasing nationalization of families and children; demands that the smallest and most important cell of our society, the family, be able to live in freedom and without state paternalism; does not want polygamy and absolute equality of same-sex partnerships with marriage; is against the adoption of children by same-sex couples; rejects state-dictated paternity or parental leave; recognizes women and men as equal partners in work and society; rejects state quota regulations and so-called gender policy; calls for the abolition of equality offices and other offices that want to regulate private life by the state and re-educate society; does not want centrally prescribed day structures, but sensible offers at the level of the community, where there is a need and the financing is primarily private; supports living together in the family, clubs, neighborhoods, churches, village and neighborhood communities; calls for the strengthening of freedom of expression by abolishing the racism penal norm. This brings me as an individual as much freedom as possible and as little state paternalism as possible; as a family, freedom to develop on my own responsibility and protection from state influence on education; as a child, love and security in the family; as a single person, that I do not always have to pay more for others; equality in the relationship between husband and wife."

The message of the Letter of Confederation of 1291 still applies to Switzerland today. Without freedom there is no self-determination. The Swiss People's Party is committed, without any ifs or buts, to a free Switzerland in which citizens can decide for themselves what they want and what they do not want. Our freedom cannot be taken for granted. It must be defended again and again against attempts at pressure from outside - but also from within. Against all those who want to patronize citizens and undermine direct democracy. For over 100 years, the SVP has been fighting for the freedom and security of the Swiss people. This is the core mission of our state system. We expect our constitutional state to provide us with security, both internally and externally, so that everyone can develop in peace and freedom. But the state today takes care of all sorts of things, but far too little of its core task: preserving the people's libertarian rights and protecting them from crime and criminals. For more freedom Our freedom includes personal co-determination at the communal, cantonal and federal levels. But it is precisely this central right to freedom, this worldwide special case, that is under massive threat today - from within even more than from outside. Direct democracy is to be abolished. Our right to vote should no longer count for anything. A majority of the Federal Council, Parliament and the Federal Supreme Court want to suspend the citizens' right of direct democratic voting. For they have found the magic formula of ""international law"" to eliminate the will of the people and declare it null and void. Freedom of expression is also part of democracy. The SVP fights against muzzles and against politically correct dictates of opinion. Threat to direct democracy Supposed political elites want to undermine our liberal federal constitution under the pretext of ""international law"" and subject us to the coercion of foreign countries. They do not want to implement popular initiatives. They want to creep us into the EU without a referendum. They have become uncomfortable and annoyed with direct democracy. Why? Because they are forced by democratic decisions to keep moderation. Most of the people in Bern prefer to make deals with foreign countries in order to gain power, privileges, high salaries and prestige for themselves. By freedom, however, we mean a life in a self-determined Switzerland, not in a Switzerland determined by others. The SVP fights against such abuses of office and stands up for democracy and thus for free citizens in a free country, for the free choice of lifestyle, workplace, leisure activities and means of transport. Freedom also means lower taxes and duties, better protection of our property, and freedom from hardship for our working and retired citizens alike. Threat to safety in everyday life The SVP will not allow the state to protect our security less and less, not to control the borders and not to deport foreign criminals. Mass immigration and a misguided asylum policy have led to a flood of people into our country, some of whose identities we do not even know. Many women and elderly citizens no longer dare to walk the streets at night. Murders, stabbings, rapes, burglaries, threats and robberies are part of the daily routine. Our beautiful country is threatened with brutalization and decay. Police officers, even paramedics, are attacked. In some places, the law of the fist prevails, and in the cities there are riots, squats and even street fights. The share of foreigners in criminal offenses is alarmingly high. Mass immigration creates uncertainty Job security is threatened above all by the free movement of persons for foreigners from the EU area. The SVP is fighting for independent control of immigration, for a genuine priority for Swiss nationals and for the reintroduction of the tried and tested quotas for foreigners. Our social security is at risk because no welfare state functions without borders. Per capita income is stagnating. And the unemployment rate according to the ILO is at a record high, despite the good economic situation. The SVP wants to financially secure AHV pensions as well as disability and unemployment insurance. It advocates for production agriculture that provides us with a measure of food security. Today, our army is less and less able to fulfill its mission due to the constant reduction by army abolitionists. The SVP fights for a credible national defense and a corresponding civil protection. Because that is SVP: freedom and security. We are home Switzerland has its own history, it is shaped by its cultures, its traditions, its values and the people who live here in peaceful coexistence. Switzerland is our home. There is no togetherness without emotions. Our mountains, lakes, valleys and landscapes trigger emotions. Our folk culture, customs, traditions are also deeply rooted in the Swiss soul memory. Home begins on a small scale: in the family, in the neighborhood, in the village. People who have a positive feeling about their immediate surroundings care, get involved, and take responsibility in the community. The most important foundation is the family. Fathers and mothers educate their children, they exemplify our Swiss values, they convey respect for what previous generations have achieved. This Switzerland cannot be taken for granted. Each generation must earn this gift anew: by taking care of Switzerland. By standing up for Switzerland without reservation. By preserving and passing on the homeland. Switzerland thrives on the militia system, on the fact that citizens engage themselves voluntarily and in an honorary capacity instead of just calling for more government. Home grows from below: in personal commitment in associations, parties, authorities and in the neighborhood, at events, festivals and celebrations. Taking personal responsibility - that's Switzerland! Home is familiarity. Home is what we miss when we are away from home. The Swiss dialect, the music, the fresh drinking water, crusty bread, the Cervelat, even the ""Aromat"". Sometimes it helps to go away, to realize what our homeland means to us, what Switzerland means to us. But it's also about the people who come to us. Which Switzerland presents itself to them? Integration can only work if Switzerland presents itself as a self-confident country with clear benchmarks. Integration must have a clearly defined goal: Switzerland is home for everyone who professes and lives Swiss values. Patriotism is a positive feeling. We can be proud and grateful to live in Switzerland. Switzerland has never paid homage to blood and soil nationalism. Switzerland has never been a monarchy, it has never run after a dictator, nor has it allowed itself to be blinded by the murderous utopias of socialism. This reluctance to accept any form of paternalism, whether from outside or from within, is rooted in Switzerland's origins. Switzerland has grown, it has shown its will for independence for centuries. We have a democratic co-determination of the population that goes back to the beginnings of the Confederation. William Tell stands for the right to resist, Arnold von Winkelried for the federal principle ""One for all, all for one"", Brother Klaus for a Switzerland of self-control (""Don't make the fence too wide""), which overcomes political, linguistic or confessional differences in the commitment to the common homeland. The deeper message - self-determination instead of heteronomy - is open to everyone, regardless of their background. Therein lies the integrative power of the Swiss idea. The left has a dysfunctional relationship with the homeland. Their self-torturing approach to Switzerland is damaging to our country - and also to integration: those who do not profess their own allegiance to Switzerland need not be surprised if parallel societies form among migrants or extremist currents, such as political Islam, advance into the vacuum. Whoever negates and despises the homeland also pushes into the European Union and thus willfully destroys the foundations of Swiss identity. Commitment to the Swiss homeland We take responsibility for our Switzerland: Each and everyone as much as he or she can. We care for our homeland: in our personal everyday life as well as in our political stance. We place the homeland and its history at the center: Swiss identity is the result of a will to self-determination that has grown over centuries, to neutrality to direct democracy and the balancing of the interests of all citizens. We provide roots: students should know and experience the Swiss Psalm as well as Swiss history, Swiss geography and customs and traditions, and Christian holidays. We are committed to the wings of our homeland and take care of tradition and local customs so that they remain alive in the future. But we also care for the cultural landscape and nature, the basis of our beautiful Switzerland. We offer a new home for immigrants: Those who come to Switzerland and adapt find a home in Switzerland. Those who do not want to profess Swiss values are free to look for another homeland. We stand by the Swiss coat of arms and its cross. Our country, our culture are Christian. However, freedom of religion and belief is also part of Switzerland, as long as these do not contradict the Swiss values that shape our understanding of the state and our legal system. Everyone who lives or wants to live in Switzerland has to respect this evolved culture. Foreign policy Independence and self-determination. The SVP is committed to preserving an independent and neutral Switzerland. The sell-out of Swiss sovereignty and self-determination by the political elites must be stopped. Therefore, our country must not continue to be creepingly integrated into international entities, such as the EU. The SVP is committed to a credible policy of good offices, mediation and humanitarian aid on the basis of neutrality. Constitution disregarded The objective of Swiss foreign policy is set out in Article 2 of the Federal Constitution: ""The Swiss Confederation shall protect the freedom and rights of the people and safeguards the independence and security of the country."" As the sovereign, the people determine the fate and future of Switzerland in freedom and independence. These values enshrined in our Federal Constitution, such as freedom, self-determination, independence and neutrality, are being insidiously undermined by the Federal Council, the Federal Administration, but also by the courts and various law professors. Neutrality is being undermined The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA), in particular, makes little effort to maintain a neutral stance in conflicts. Diplomats and federal councillors prefer to be celebrated in the spotlight and openly take sides in power-political disputes. In this regard, it would behoove Switzerland to adopt a comprehensively neutral stance so that it could offer its good offices as a credible mediator between conflict parties. It is also diametrically opposed to neutrality for Switzerland to seek a seat on the UN Security Council. But this has been the plan of the classe politique in Bern for years. The UN Security Council is the place where the so-called world peace and thus also wars and sanctions are decided. It is not possible to adopt an impartial stance. However, this interference in the global scramble for power and prestige cannot bring any advantages to the small neutral state of Switzerland. International law is prioritized Today, international law is ranked higher than the law enacted by parliament and the people in their own country. This is reflected in the fact that more and more popular initiatives are not being implemented or are not being implemented correctly. However, this foreign law, which is often deceptively titled ""international law,"" has little or often no democratic legitimacy. The reference to human rights is also misleading. What is now called human rights in the political calculation for power and influence has nothing to do with the initial meaning, but is a further development and expanding interpretation of the original Charter of Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights. The international courts are increasingly putting aside their restraint, interfering in national law and disregarding the constitutions of states. Self-determination and autonomy in law-making are thus being increasingly undermined. The regulatory achievement of the separation of powers is lost. Creeping EU accession Self-determination means: no institutional integration into the EU and thus no imposed adoption of laws and no foreign judges. The most dangerous attack on our self-determination is the planned institutional link to the EU. The Federal Council and the EU are planning to conclude a framework agreement. This stipulates that Switzerland must submit to the legal development and jurisdiction of the EU. This is accompanied by the adoption of EU laws. This transfer of rights is to be ""dynamic"". In plain language, this means nothing other than that Switzerland can be subjected to sanctions if it does not adopt EU requirements or does not do so in the way the EU would like. Whether Switzerland acts to the EU's liking in individual cases would be decided by EU judges. This submissive path leading to dependence must not be followed. Switzerland must retain its independence in order to defend its prosperity and economic success. Good services The commitment of the Red Cross, Switzerland's humanitarian efforts and the location of the international Geneva are part of our positive international reputation and support Switzerland's impartial and all-round open attitude. This successful role is that of the paramedic on the sidelines, who provides first aid quickly, unbureaucratically, unobtrusively and impartially. Discreet diplomatic efforts at peace and reconciliation are preferable to loud declarations in the context of conference tourism. While the humanitarian commitment should remain in place, development aid needs to be cleaned up. For example, the disbursement of development aid funds should be linked to repatriation agreements for asylum seekers and illegal migrants. Instead of constantly increasing public spending on development aid, private willingness to donate should be encouraged through tax relief. Restrict foreign aid Despite decades of payments of immense sums of development aid by the West, the African continent, for example, is not significantly better off than before. Civil wars, corruption and state collapse threaten many countries. The migration flows from South to North are still continuing and allow only one conclusion to be drawn: the expensive state aid projects of recent decades have failed to achieve their goal. Development aid favors and even enables migration. Not only are public funds often wasted, but dictatorial, corrupt regimes and clans are indirectly kept alive. This shows that there is a great need for action. The funds may not be increased. Endless permanent development aid projects that prove to be a bottomless pit must be stopped. Impartiality pays off The Federal Council must return to a permanently armed, perpetual and comprehensive understanding of neutrality. Comprehensive neutrality in this context means not only neutrality understood in purely legal and military terms (neutrality law), but also neutrality in practice (neutrality policy), which commits all government actions in foreign policy to impartiality and non-interference at all times. However, Switzerland also needs to be ready for defense in the form of an operational militia army with sufficient personnel, budget and material, which is what makes Switzerland's independence and neutrality credible in the first place. The Confederation must not support any unilateral sanctions policy (diplomatic, financial and economic), including those of the UN, the EU or the OSCE. Relations with the whole world Switzerland must also intensify its efforts to trade with all states and organizations and not focus unilaterally on the EU in this area. This universalistic foreign trade policy includes deliberate diversification through balanced free trade agreements with as many states as possible, because trade is the best basis for friendly relations and lasting peace. Economic links are therefore also an expression of mutual common interests. Economic-political relations do not require political institutions, organizations and attempts at connection. The country's own law must take precedence over the law of international institutions that are remote from the people. Standardization and egalitarianism even contradict free trade. Freedom, innovation and success thrive on competition and rivalry. Successful Switzerland thanks to EEA No The remoteness from citizens and the democratic deficits of the Brussels bureaucracy are rightly the subject of constant criticism. In contrast, Switzerland is superior to the EU in all rankings: in terms of attractiveness as a business location, prosperity, social system, debt, and even the happiness of its citizens. If Switzerland is not a member of the EU today, it is not thanks to complacent elites in politics, business, society and the media, but solely to the special case of direct democracy with the right of the people to have their say. And it is to the SVP's credit that it has fought on the side of the people against EU and EEA accession for over two decades. Interestingly, contrary to all predictions and assertions, not joining the EEA did not herald Switzerland's downfall. Since the 1990s, Switzerland has been doing better than ever economically - precisely because of its autonomy and independence. It is therefore surprising that the same old refrain is being heard again today in relation to the EU: without integration or without further agreements with the EU, we would fall into poverty, the administration and economic functionaries trumpet to the country. Obviously, however, these scaremongers are not to be believed. No integration with the EU While Switzerland needs good economic and friendly-neighborly relations with the EU, we are by no means dependent on state involvement that leads us solely into subservience. Bilateral relations and treaties in the interest of both sides are to be advocated, but not an EU integration policy that has EU accession as its ultimate goal or makes us more and more dependent and adapted until we are creeping in after all. Switzerland's self-determination and independence as well as the rights of the people must be strengthened. Further adjustments and harmonization with the EU must not be accepted. Why should we conform to an obviously worse system, characterized by high youth unemployment, symptoms of poverty, remoteness from citizens, bureaucracy and centralism? Switzerland's successful values, such as freedom, independence, neutrality, direct democracy, federalism and market economy, must be defended relentlessly. Viewpoints The SVP ... demands that the primary objectives of our foreign policy be to guarantee Switzerland's freedom, self-determination, people's rights, independence and neutrality; demands that Switzerland, as a small state, lives up to its proven track record of good offices through diplomacy, the ICRC and the Humanitarian Aid Unit, instead of striving to become a great power; calls for Switzerland to exercise restraint in international crises instead of rashly pointing the finger at others, making unilateral condemnations and imposing sanctions; demands that Swiss delegates in international bodies (e.g. UN, OECD, etc.) increasingly represent the interests of an independent Switzerland; opposes Switzerland's seat on the UN Security Council; fights against creeping EU accession; is committed to pursuing the bilateral path with the EU on an equal footing; is against the EU cohesion billion without equivalent counter-performance; is in favor of a sharp reduction in state development aid spending and the transfer of funds released to the AHV to safeguard pensions; is in favor of a time limit on state bilateral development aid. The time limit is to be contractually regulated with the recipient countries and multilaterally no new commitments are to be made in development aid; demands that development aid be linked to the repatriation of asylum seekers and that asylum expenditures be fully counted as development aid; strives, taking into account agricultural interests, for relations with all states of the world on the basis of free trade agreements instead of fixating on the EU. Advantages As a voter, this gives me the security of being able to decide for myself which rules apply in Switzerland in the future; as an entrepreneur, good relations with the whole world and less bureaucracy; As a taxpayer, I have the certainty of not having to pay for the mismanagement of other countries; as a citizen, a government that stands up for the interests of Switzerland and its citizens instead of seeking the limelight on the world stage. Switzerland as a workplace More economic freedom instead of bureaucracy The SVP is fighting for more entrepreneurial freedom and against ever new laws and bans that burden our companies. The tendencies of recent years to regulate the liberal labor market more and more, to make energy and transportation more expensive and to increase bureaucracy must finally be stopped. Our successful small and medium-sized enterprises, but also the many large companies based in Switzerland, must be taken care of. The SVP stands for Swiss quality and fights for competitive framework conditions in order to secure jobs in Switzerland. Difficult times for a liberal economic policy Those who create jobs are social. Because work is the most reliable means of combating poverty. Therein lies the reason why liberal market economies have historically and globally been the most successful and have the least poverty. Our country is still quite well positioned economically. But productivity and per capita income in Switzerland are stagnating or growing only slowly. Jobs and prosperity will only be created if companies find favorable conditions in which investments are worthwhile. The public sector is growing In recent years, employment has grown almost exclusively in the public sector, administration, healthcare and social services. The large number of newly created government positions is a burden not only on taxpayers, but also on the economy. More civil servants automatically lead to even more state bureaucracy, actionism and even more adoption of law from the EU. The market and competition are then replaced by government regulations and interventionism as well as international egalitarianism, which force entrepreneurs out of the market. Unnecessary monopolies such as Swiss Post, Suva or the SRG also make services more expensive and prevent genuine competition. Financial center under constant attack The normal business goal of every entrepreneur, employer, and trader to make a profit is now being morally challenged. At the same time, capable entrepreneurs and tradesmen, with the jobs they offer, are the true social workers in our country. The financial center was under particular pressure. The banking, insurance and financial sector accounts for around 10 percent of Switzerland's total economic output. Envy and bankrupt foreign treasuries repeatedly make this industry a target for hostile attacks from abroad, which find compliant helpers at home, right up to the Federal Council. Thus, banking secrecy and financial privacy vis-à-vis foreign countries were de facto abolished, and locational advantages were fully surrendered with reference to international standards or consumer protection. The financial privacy of citizens vis-à-vis foreign countries is already badly damaged. The SVP rejects any further erosion of privacy through an expansion of the exchange of information, because such efforts, especially automatisms, contradict important principles of Switzerland, such as the protection of privacy or a relationship between citizen and state based on good faith. Privacy of the Swiss inviolable In particular, domestic bank-client confidentiality must continue to exist in the future. Individuals domiciled or companies domiciled in Switzerland, should continue to be protected in their financial privacy. In the area of European and global legislation, the SVP continues to fight for Switzerland to adopt only those international standards that are mandatory to ensure global market access. It must be recalled that the Swiss financial industry owes its strong position to the country's know-how, political and economic stability, legal certainty, the security of the country in general and the preservation of financial privacy. Apart from know-how, these pillars of success are now under threat. Tourism under pressure Tourism, with its numerous jobs, is also of great importance to the Swiss economy. However, the unique scenic beauty of our country is also countered by burdensome factors such as crumbling foreign currencies, high costs or outdated structures. Many, but not all, of the problems can be handled by tourism businesses alone. However, they depend on positive framework conditions. In the fight against the cost explosion, the SVP supports the retention of the special VAT rate for the hotel and catering industry. Strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises More than 99% of companies in Switzerland are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with fewer than 250 employees. Two-thirds of Swiss employees work in SMEs. SMEs thus represent the backbone of our national economy. The SVP is aware of their importance and is particularly committed to their welfare. The National Councillors of the SVP were the strongest supporters of SME-related business issues, according to a survey by the Swiss Trade Association. An analysis of 215 votes on 169 SME-relevant topics in the National Council already showed in 2015 that 41 members of the SVP were among the first 50 National Councilors. SVP representatives occupy the top four places in the Council of States. No other party represents business and industry as consistently as the SVP. The SVP rejects unnecessary regulations, new laws, regulations and bans, as well as automatic adoption of laws from the EU, which are poison for companies and businesses. Protection of the flexible labor market means protection against unemployment A flexible labor market is the best protection against unemployment and allows a maximum of people to access the labor market and make a good living. Liberal labor law and free, decentralized wage formation between employer and employee are the assets of the Swiss labor market. However, since the introduction of the free movement of persons in 2002, collective labor agreements (CLAs) have increased massively in Switzerland. Today, more than two million employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Unions act as official representatives for over half of all workers, although only 15 percent of the workforce is a member of a union. The fact that the Federal Council and the cantons are increasingly regulating the labor market via generally binding collective bargaining agreements is alarming. The number of generally binding collective labor agreements has more than doubled since 2001. Research and innovation place Innovation is the driver of economic development. Switzerland, with its high cost structures, small home market and lack of raw materials, is imperatively dependent on innovation and is therefore considered the innovation world champion. The research and innovation center depends on favorable framework conditions. These include a well-educated workforce, restrained regulation, a competitive tax environment, political stability, and intellectual property protection. Therefore, we must also take care of our unique dual vocational training system, which is the best protection against youth unemployment in the world and ensures well-trained professionals. Trade with the whole world Free trade, i.e. an international exchange of goods and services that is not hindered by tariffs and other trade barriers, is the engine of the global economy. As a small state heavily dependent on exports, exporting goods worth more than 233 billion Swiss francs in 2018, our country has strived for the most barrier-free trade possible and corresponding free trade agreements from an early stage. Switzerland should intensify its efforts to conclude further free trade agreements worldwide - with special attention to agriculture (and self-sufficiency). Due to the changing importance of markets, especially against the backdrop of emerging markets, it is important that Switzerland takes a universal approach to this and does not focus unilaterally on the EU. Since Switzerland, as an independent small state, cannot exercise power politics worldwide, it is dependent on binding trade rules anyway. For this reason, it is also a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is committed to enabling and enforcing liberal world trade. Back to liberal values Ultimately, the state must neither compete with nor hinder the economy, but should provide the basic conditions for economic activity to be as free as possible. Because where bureaucracy is rampant, entrepreneurial activity is inevitably restricted and regulatory costs get out of hand. State-imposed, bureaucratic idling - namely the influences of a possible institutional framework agreement with the EU - harm companies and thus Switzerland. The SVP is therefore committed to ensuring that instead of increasing government actionism, more emphasis is placed on personal responsibility. Viewpoints The SVP ... calls for optimal framework conditions for the small, medium-sized and large companies that form the backbone of our prosperity; calls for more freedom and less regulation, rules and bans to safeguard existing jobs and create new ones; requires that the state neither competes with nor hinders the economy; wants to preserve the Swiss franc as an independent and autonomous currency; is against the restriction or abolition of cash as legal tender; is against increases in value added tax; stands by the Swiss financial center and Swiss bank-client confidentiality; calls for the protection of intellectual property; calls for the preservation of strategic infrastructure (water, energy, roads, etc.) in Swiss hands; supports Switzerland as a center of research and innovation, entrepreneurship and young entrepreneurs; is committed to lower non-wage labor costs; rejects state quota regulations; demands that the quorums for declaring generally binding agreements should not be lowered under any circumstances and that the validity of generally binding collective employment agreements should not be extended beyond the sector. wants to make the Swiss labor market flexible and modern, make working time recording more flexible and strengthen self-employment; opposes all new accompanying measures and wants to reduce the existing ones as soon as Switzerland once again controls immigration independently. Advantages This brings me: as an employee, a secure job; more money for innovation as an entrepreneur; as a trader and producing farmer, less bureaucracy and paperwork; as a hotelier and restaurateur a better position on the market and more customers; As a bank customer, I can rest assured that my financial data will not be accessed automatically in the future. Finance, taxes and duties More for the middle class, less for the state The state is growing and growing. Federal spending has more than doubled since 1990. The public sector is taking on more and more tasks. As politicians are unwilling to get a grip on the explosion in expenditure, taxes, levies and fees are being increased. SMEs in particular are paying the price. This dynamic must finally be broken, because the prosperity of the entire country depends on a healthy middle class. Every franc that is spent must first be earned. Stop the ever-increasing excessive spending Despite positive financial statements, federal finances are in poor shape, fueled by an expansive spending policy. Whereas in 1990 a good 32 billion francs were spent, in 2017 the figure was 68 billion francs. This corresponds to more than a doubling. In 2021, the Federal Council wants to spend 77 billion francs according to the financial plan. In recent years, the federal government has increased its spending by just over three percent year over year. This is based on average economic growth of around 2%. Grossly unequal treatment between spending areas While savings have been made in agriculture and the army for years, other areas are growing unchecked. Social welfare is by far the largest expenditure item. It now takes up more than one-third of total federal spending. Contrary to the left-wing mantra that ""social cuts"" are being made in Switzerland and the state is being ""cut to the bone"", the social sector is actually flourishing. Federal spending on social welfare has increased from 14 billion francs (2000) to 23 billion francs (2019 budget) since the beginning of this millennium alone, i.e. it has been increased by more than half. This means that more money is spent on social welfare alone than on education, transport and national defense combined. The administration grows at our expense The federal administration has also grown rapidly in recent years. While personnel expenses were still at 4.5 billion Swiss francs in 2007, they already amounted to 5.9 billion Swiss francs in 2017, an increase of over twenty percent in just ten years. A considerable proportion of this growth is due to new jobs and changes in function. A total of 36,946 people already work for the federal government in 2017, compared with around 32,000 in 2007. Stop the bus terror In addition to taxes, levies and fees that have been increased by the federal government, cantons and municipalities in recent years (e.g. CO2 levies, solidarity percentage ALV, waste and wastewater fees, etc.), the public sector is allocating more and more funds to itself through fines. Many cantons and municipalities have inconspicuously but steadily increased their revenues from this in recent years. Fines and fees are becoming more and more fiscal in nature. The effect as a punishment or to increase safety, recedes into the background. The mechanism for fines is clear: thanks to more fine revenue, the authorities can access citizens' money relatively easily, whereas taxes can only be increased with the consent of the people. So that there is more to live for Prosperity and jobs can only be maintained if citizens and companies can once again dispose of their money more freely. Today, we have to spend almost half the year working for compulsory state levies (taxes, premiums, charges and fees). Only a significant reduction in taxes and duties will lead to more private investment, more consumption and therefore more growth, jobs and apprenticeships. The SVP therefore opposes all new taxes, levies and charges and, on the contrary, calls for tax relief. Questions of interpretation shall be settled in favor of the population and enterprises liable to pay taxes and duties. Lean state The SVP is strongly in favor of a cost-effective, lean state. From the SVP's point of view, it is crucial that the lever is applied on the expenditure side. It must not be the case that new sources of revenue are constantly being tapped to finance new government tasks. The SVP sees an urgent need for action, particularly with regard to the exploding expenditure on social welfare, for which one in three Swiss francs is now spent. Structural measures to safeguard our social achievements are imperative here. There must be no further expansion. Likewise, the massively increasing expenditures for foreign and development aid of more than 3 billion Swiss francs annually must be limited. Maintaining tax competition The SVP is the party of federalism and thus of the tax sovereignty of the cantons and municipalities. Only in this way can competition take place, and only in this way are authorities that have become comfortable forced to shape their tax policies in favor of citizens instead of in the service of their administrative interests. Pressure from abroad on the Swiss tax system must be resisted. Internationally advantageous special tax regulations are only to be adjusted if they are compensated by tax relief in other areas. The SVP is committed to ensuring that Switzerland is a competitive tax location for all companies. Fair national financial equalization Within the framework of national fiscal equalization (NFA), the resources, burdens and hardship equalization redistributes financial resources from the Confederation to the cantons and between the resource-strong and resource-weak cantons. From the SVP's point of view, the financial and burden equalization must be appropriate and fair so that the differences between the cantons can be efficiently reduced and excessive financial burdens due to their structural conditions can be compensated. This requires an upper limit for the NFA and positive incentives for recipient cantons to improve their financial strength. The so-called ""solidarity liability"", which penalizes both budgetary donor and recipient cantons, must be abolished. Viewpoints The SVP ... advocates lower taxes, levies and fees for all and rejects any new ones; wants to reduce development aid spending by at least one billion francs and shift the amount to the AHV; fights to ensure that the state does not spend more than it takes in and that spending is based on revenue and not vice versa; rejects any softening of the debt brake. Budget surpluses must continue to be used in full to reduce debt; requires regular and comprehensive task reviews to reduce superfluous administrative tasks and units; calls for a reduction in federal personnel to the 2015 level and a massive reduction in financial personnel expenses in the central administration (staff, communication, consultants, etc.); calls for additional relief programs to slow down the rapid growth in federal spending; advocates a reduction in committed expenditure; advocates a financial referendum so that the people have the final say on financial expenditure; requires that the state does not grow faster than the economy; demands internationally competitive corporate taxation; is against any increase in VAT; calls for the abolition of the marriage penalty, which puts married couples at a tax disadvantage; demands that fines are not misused as a convenient source of income for the state coffers; is committed to preserving Switzerland's tried-and-tested system of federal taxation; demands an upper limit for the NFA as a whole and for the donor cantons individually; wants to abolish joint liability in the NFA. Advantages As an employee, this gives me more money in my wallet at the end of the month and secures my job; lower prices as a consumer; as car and motorcycle drivers less bus terror and moderate fuel prices; as an entrepreneur more money for investments in the future. Strengthen property - preserve freedom Against expropriation, for the protection of privacy The guarantee of private property is one of the most important tasks of a liberal democratic state. The SVP is committed to ensuring that citizens can freely dispose of the material and non-material goods they have acquired. This includes the state leaving as much money as possible in its citizens' wallets for their free disposal. However, the defense of citizens' privacy is also becoming increasingly important. The transparent citizen must not be allowed to exist. Against left-wing redistribution Those who work and put aside some money on their own responsibility and want to have some of their savings later on have every reason to fight left-wing policies. For most of their advances are aimed at getting more of other people's money, taking away people's property and redistributing it. No one thinks more materialistically and selfishly than the political left, which wants to solve every problem with other people's money. Whether it's the integration of foreigners, early retirement, childcare places, crèches, day schools, parental leave or social housing: for the left, everything is a question of money, which the classe politique may dispose of and which must be redistributed. The state grows and grows The state has grown larger and larger in recent years and has greatly increased the density of regulation. We work more and more of the year to pay taxes, duties and fees. The state is taking on more and more tasks that were previously performed privately. Six months of the year we work for the state. This puts Switzerland above the average for OECD countries. More freedom for home ownership The property of the Swiss is not only threatened by the increasing tax and duty burden. The acquisition of residential property is also threatened by increasing government requirements and restrictions. This is also detrimental to tenants, because only as long as investing, building and renovating is worthwhile will sufficient living space be created at reasonable prices. However, the play of the free market is severely restricted in today's tenancy law by over-regulation. In addition, there are always new building requirements in the areas of energy, security and fees/charges, which make housing more expensive for everyone. Less and less private In addition to property, leftists and other believers in the state also want to take away our privacy: Abolition of bank client confidentiality, automatic exchange of information, restriction of cash transactions, surveillance at every turn. The state is intervening ever more brazenly in our private lives. The goal is always to educate citizens and take even more money out of their pockets. The SVP does not accept this. Instead, the privacy of citizens must be respected and protected. The SVP is fighting just as vehemently for the preservation of bank client confidentiality in Switzerland and against ever more opportunities for the authorities to encroach on citizens' privacy and to monitor and violate it. Strengthening ownership The SVP is fully committed to ensuring that citizens can freely dispose of their legally acquired material and non-material assets. Without constitutionally guaranteed property, neither the individual's right to self-determination nor a free and prosperous society is possible. History has shown time and again that as soon as a state no longer guarantees its inhabitants' property or even takes it away, people's life and limb are soon at risk. Less state redistribution The SVP is also fighting against even more redistribution. In the sense of a liberal state based on personal responsibility, every citizen should be able to use his property and his money as freely as possible in the way he himself sees fit. The SVP does not want a state that takes people's hard-earned money out of their pockets and redistributes it - even if the idea behind it is well-intentioned. Every citizen knows best where and how they want to use their money on their own responsibility. If this principle is further undermined, it leads to socialism, in which the state takes property away from citizens for the purposes it sets. Less bureaucracy in planning and building law In the real estate sector, the SVP is calling for a relaxation of rental management regulations and rent control. The SVP demands that house and apartment ownership be promoted through tax incentives. The current imputed rental value taxation has an anti-ownership effect and should therefore be abolished. The SVP rejects state social housing. Social housing always leads to competition-distorting effects that have a negative impact on private investment. Viewpoints The SVP ... stands for as little state intervention and regulation as possible; upholds the protection of private property; combats tendencies to restrict the use of cash and the state's recourse to savings and pension fund assets; campaigns against anti-property regulations in tenancy and building law and in the real estate sector; is in favor of abolishing the taxation of imputed rental value, which is detrimental to property ownership; wants a flattening of progressive tax rates; defends intellectual property as an important basis for Switzerland as a research and production location; is committed to the protection of privacy and against excessive state surveillance. Advantages That brings me: the right to self-determination as a citizen; more to live on as a family; as an employee or pensioner, less burden from taxes and contributions; as a homeowner, the security of my property; as a bank customer, the protection of my privacy; as an entrepreneur the well-deserved reward from my developments and innovations; As a pension fund policyholder, I have the security of knowing that the capital I have paid in belongs to me. Foreigners Policy Reduce immigration to a healthy level Those who come to Switzerland should be able to take care of themselves, integrate and abide by the local legal system. Immigration should bring benefits to Switzerland. Uncontrolled immigration from the EU is putting increasing pressure on older workers in particular. Instead of skilled workers, cheap labor and their dependents are coming to Switzerland. The referendum to control immigration independently again must finally be taken seriously. Attractive Switzerland Switzerland is a beautiful country with a high quality of life and considerable prosperity - and should remain so. It is not surprising that Switzerland is a popular destination for immigrants. Immigration to our country is attractive to foreigners for economic, political and social reasons. All the more reason for us to ensure that immigration does not exceed a healthy level. To achieve this, we must once again be able to determine for ourselves who and how many are allowed to immigrate. Establish and enforce clear rules of the game Switzerland must establish clear rules of the game vis-à-vis foreigners and enforce them consistently. It must be clear to everyone who is allowed to be here and under what circumstances. Anyone who becomes a burden on the state, commits a criminal offense, stubbornly opposes local customs and traditions or displays radical tendencies is to be expelled. A more consistent approach makes our laws more credible, brings us more security and less social costs. At the same time, this rewards those foreigners who are willing to contribute, integrate well, and play by the rules. Proven specialists instead of low-wage workers Internationally active companies must be able to attract the best talent to Switzerland in order to survive in global competition. This is important for Switzerland as a location for leading research institutions and manufacturers of innovative products. But while the immigration of specialists from so-called third countries (outside the EU) is restricted, everyone can immigrate to Switzerland from the EU because of the free movement of persons, regardless of their qualifications. Prosperity stagnates due to immigration Business associations such as ""economiesuisse"" claim that Switzerland has benefited from the free movement of persons because, after all, the gross domestic product has grown. But why does the individual citizen not notice anything about it, why are wages stagnating? The pie is getting slightly bigger, but it has to be distributed among many more people in our country. Since the introduction of the free movement of persons with the EU, the number of foreigners has increased by 1.1 million (700,000 from the EU alone) to a good 2.1 million people. Every fourth inhabitant of Switzerland is now a foreigner. Gross domestic product per capita is stagnating at around 79,000 Swiss francs (2017). Switzerland is falling behind in terms of value creation and productivity. That has to change. Unbridled immigration has consequences for everyone The consequences of population growth can be felt and experienced by everyone on a daily basis: overcrowded trains, congested roads, rising rents and land prices, loss of valuable land and the need to build new homes. cultivated land due to development of the landscape, wage pressure, displacement on the labor market, cultural change in management levels. Today's immigration excesses endanger our freedom, security, full employment, our landscape. The SVP does not want a 10-million Switzerland. Free movement of persons: a failed experiment Since the introduction of the free movement of persons with the EU, we no longer determine ourselves who is allowed to come to Switzerland and who is not. This must stop. It would never occur to traditional immigration countries such as the U.S., Canada or Australia to grant a legal right to immigrate to over 500 million citizens of other countries. On the contrary, many countries are tightening their immigration laws against the backdrop of global political developments. The goal must be to orient immigration strictly according to economic needs, in the interest of security, and according to Switzerland's available resources. Limitation initiative regulates immigration With the ""Popular Initiative for Moderate Immigration"", the SVP wants to achieve independent control of immigration and a ban on any free movement of persons. The initiative was submitted on August 31, 2018 with 119,000 valid signatures. Because Parliament refused to implement the mass immigration initiative, the people must now put their foot down. The Federal Council should be instructed to negotiate with the EU and to suspend the agreement on the free movement of persons no later than twelve months after the initiative is adopted. If an agreement cannot be reached within this period, the agreement on the free movement of persons must be terminated within 30 days. Restrict social benefits and family reunification Clear restrictions on family reunification and social benefits should ensure that no foreigners immigrate to Switzerland who cannot support themselves and only want to live off the state. For example, the principle should apply that only those who have paid unemployment insurance contributions in Switzerland for at least two years receive unemployment benefits. Such time limits are also to be specified throughout Switzerland for the receipt of welfare benefits. In the case of family reunification, it must be ensured that only those people who can provide for their families and have a large, self-financed apartment are allowed to join them. By lowering the demands on the state in this way, immigration can be severely restricted without depriving the economy of important skilled workers. Consistent action against illegals Switzerland must finally crack down on illegal immigrants and illegal residents. To this end, the current laws on foreigners would simply have to be applied strictly and consistently. The cantons are also called upon to do this. Newly introduced regulations, according to which illegally present persons can attend schools, complete apprenticeships and even pay into the AHV, contradict any normal understanding of the law. Because the so-called ""SansPapiers"" are not only here illegally, they also do not pay any taxes. Persons apprehended without valid residence documents must be deported. In order to make illegal entry more difficult, the borders must be better controlled again. Those foreigners who seek regular residence in Switzerland are now disadvantaged and the wrong incentives are being created. Integration must start with the immigrants Integration is the task of the immigrants. Anyone who wants to immigrate to a country must be aware in advance of what this means. It is important to learn the local language and become familiar with the customs and traditions. Only if the will to integrate emanates from the immigrants can it be successful. Today, however, politicians are increasingly taking the opposite approach: the authorities should ensure that foreigners integrate. The incentive for integration is to be bought with expensive state measures and offers - financed by tax money. Those who do not want to integrate should leave the country again. Naturalization as the completion of integration Only those who have successfully integrated, stand on their own two feet, have no criminal record and have a good command of a national language should be able to naturalize. Only those who have taken this step should be given the privilege of having a say in politics. The SVP rejects the right of foreigners to vote, as well as any further facilitation of naturalization. To prevent naturalized citizens from becoming criminals shortly after receiving citizenship, a probationary naturalization process should be introduced. Only those who have proven over several years that they abide by our legal system should finally receive a Swiss passport. Dual nationals who commit serious crimes or join extremist organizations should have their Swiss passports revoked. High naturalization figures for years The left tries to explain the high proportion of foreigners by saying that Switzerland is very restrictive when it comes to naturalization. However, this contradicts the naturalization statistics. Since 2002, Switzerland has naturalized between 35,000 and 46,000 foreigners each year, and the trend is rising. Measured against the total population, this is very high by international standards. This puts us in the top 5 in Europe. Nevertheless, the proportion of foreigners is increasing from year to year. Problems ""naturalized"" The lax naturalization practice in certain cantons and left-wing governed cities has led to many people receiving Swiss passports who are not integrated at all or are poorly integrated. Quite a few new Swiss hardly speak a national language, do not recognize the local customs or become delinquent shortly after naturalization. Statistically, however, these people are then recorded as Swiss. This simply naturalized many foreigner problems. Naturalization must be at the end of successful integration. Swiss citizenship may only be granted if the person behaves correctly, has his or her own livelihood and has a good knowledge of at least one national language. Viewpoints The SVP ... wants to achieve independent control of immigration and a ban on the free movement of persons with the ""Limitation Initiative""; wants to facilitate the recruitment of proven foreign specialists for the benefit of our economy, including from countries outside the EU; wants to prevent immigration from putting further pressure on wages and forcing older workers in particular out of the labor market; calls for the consistent and swift deportation of illegal residents and criminal foreigners; calls for the restriction of family reunification and social benefits for all immigrants in order to prevent immigration into the welfare state; demands the withdrawal of the residence permit if the dependency on social welfare lasts longer than two years; demands that everyone adheres to the local rules, customs and traditions; combats the bloating of expensive state integration measures. Integration must come from the immigrants; does not accept that cantons provide social assistance to people with a legally binding deportation order who should have left Switzerland long ago; fights against the naturalization of criminals and welfare recipients; opposes any further facilitation of naturalization; calls for probationary naturalization so that people who become criminals shortly after receiving a Swiss passport can have their citizenship revoked; opposes any form of voting rights for foreigners; calls for the Federal Council to submit an ordinary federal decree to Parliament that is subject to a referendum before approving the migration and refugee pact and before adopting so-called ""soft law"". Advantages This brings me: at work, less competitive pressure from cheap labor from the EU; as a voter, the opportunity to have a say in immigration policy; as a neighbor, foreigners who abide by the local rules; fellow citizens who are truly integrated and with whom I can communicate without any problems; more security, because criminal foreigners are consistently deported; a Switzerland that remains as we know and love it. Asylum policy Stop asylum chaos Switzerland has a humanitarian tradition and accepts people who are persecuted in life and limb. Since there is no longer a clear demarcation between asylum and migration policy, we in Switzerland have to afford thousands of economic refugees at state expense. The authorities are systematically led around by the nose. The SVP says war on the misguided asylum policy, which leads to exploding costs, more crime and social problems. Human, not naive Switzerland has always taken in people who were persecuted and whose lives were threatened in their home country. Our humanitarian tradition predates any international refugee or human rights convention. But this humanitarian tradition does not mean that we have to put on rose-colored glasses. Fact: There is less and less clear distinction between asylum seekers and economic migrants (guest workers). More and more people from the poorer regions of the world are abusing the asylum route to seek their fortune in Switzerland without a visa or residence permit. By funding economic refugees from A to Z through the state and thus the Swiss taxpayer, we are virtually inviting them to pose as ""refugees"" and creating injustice against all those who abide by immigration laws. Asylum industry is a billion-dollar business Those who apply for asylum here receive state support from day one. He can receive free medical care, move freely, and is joyfully welcomed, counseled, and cared for by asylum lawyers and relief agencies. Because of this all-round state provision, a veritable asylum industry has now sprung up. Left-wing lawyers, social workers and other profiteers are unlikely to be interested in discouraging appeals or encouraging a quick return home. As a result, proceedings often drag on for an unnecessarily long time. Even persons for whom it is clear from the outset that they will not be persecuted are thus allowed to remain in Switzerland for years, sometimes their entire lives. ""Schengen/Dublin"" does not work Because of the ""Schengen/Dublin"" agreement, Switzerland is no longer allowed to systematically control its borders. The goal is that illegal immigration is repelled at the Schengen external border. But EU border protection is not working. Unscrupulous smugglers and human traffickers are the profiteers. Once in Europe, only some of the immigrants are registered. In doing so, the overburdened Mediterranean countries are clearly violating the Dublin Agreement. Free travel (open Schengen borders) within Europe means that illegals are only apprehended by chance. The migrants can thus travel unhindered and unregistered to that country where they receive the best benefits, i.e. to Northern Europe and Switzerland. Even those who have already been registered in another country often cannot be returned. Because either the respective states refuse or the deadline is missed willfully. Costs in the asylum sector increase markedly The volume of asylum applications has a direct impact on the cost of asylum. For example, annual costs of over CHF 1.4 billion are expected at the federal level alone by 2022. Compared to 2014, this is a cost increase of over 57%. These are primarily transfer payments to the cantons. Indeed, the Confederation has undertaken to reimburse the social assistance of refugees for 5 to 7 years, depending on their status. After this deadline, the cantons and municipalities will bear the full financial consequences of the federal government's disastrous asylum policy. This includes follow-on costs for schools, remedial education, social workers, infrastructure, care industry, police, courts and related interpretation services, etc. Municipalities and cantons must increase taxes The responsible federal department refuses to calculate the total costs of the asylum system in Switzerland, even when asked by parliament. One refers succinctly to the shared responsibility of the Confederation and the cantons, although statistics are compiled in other policy areas. It is clear that municipalities and cantons are already groaning under the immense social welfare costs of the asylum system. One example is the Aargau municipality of Aarburg with its 8,000 inhabitants: one third of the entire municipal budget is spent on social welfare. A large proportion of the recipients are former asylum seekers. This situation will worsen throughout Switzerland when the federal subsidies for the record year 2015 expire one day. Switzerland-wide, the social assistance rate in the asylum sector was an incredible 90.4% in 2017. It is mainly the middle class that pays. Excessively high crime rate among asylum seekers High costs in the cantons are also caused by the fight against crime and the penal system. This is because asylum seekers violate the Swiss legal system many times more frequently than Swiss or other resident foreigners do. While people in the asylum sector make up about 1.4% of the population, asylum seekers were responsible for over 10% of all rapes and homicides in 2017. Those who violate the legal order of the host country in such a way cannot really be threatened in life and limb, otherwise they would not jeopardize their safe haven with criminal behavior. Unruly and delinquent asylum seekers should be housed in closed centers and expelled from the country as soon as possible. Political leadership is crucial The responsibility for the state of the asylum system lies with the responsible member of the Federal Council and his political will. Instead of solving the problems, they rush from announcement to announcement and pass the buck to the cantons and municipalities. These then have to solve accommodation issues, security problems, integration tasks that should not even exist in the first place. It is imperative to ensure at federal level that Switzerland becomes unattractive for bogus asylum seekers and economic migrants. Asylum abusers must be sent back to their home countries as quickly as possible. Measures against illegal entry The most effective way to solve the problems in the asylum system would be to ensure that bogus refugees do not come to Switzerland in the first place. Since the control at the ""Schengen"" external border has been proven not to work and individual EU states do not adhere to the ""Dublin"" agreement, Switzerland must again systematically control its borders itself. The Border Guard Corps must be equipped with modern technical surveillance equipment and supported by the cantonal police corps and, if necessary, the army. No entry from safe countries Illegal entry and residence, as well as aiding and abetting, must be prosecuted consistently. Anyone who enters Switzerland from a state in which he is not persecuted should not be entitled to asylum, since genuinely persecuted persons should already have found protection in that state. This principle, on which the ""Dublin"" agreement is also based, must finally be enforced. In the case of war refugees, the focus should also be on providing help on the ground and in their immediate geographical environment. Reduce attractiveness for bogus refugees It should no longer be worthwhile for bogus refugees to apply for asylum in Switzerland. The attractiveness of the Swiss asylum system must therefore be significantly reduced. On the one hand, social benefits should be reduced in general to increase the incentive for recognized refugees to work. On the other hand, emergency and social assistance for persons in the asylum and refugee system is to be paid only in kind and in vouchers. Money transfers to the countries of origin must be consistently stopped, as these encourage even more people to leave for Europe. During the procedure, asylum seekers should be housed in controlled centers with clearly defined movement rayons to prevent absconding. All technical means, including cell phone data and social networks as well as intelligence sources, must be exhausted to verify the origin of asylum seekers and their account of the facts. Those who boycott the procedure or do not comply with the Swiss legal system should be placed in a closed center until further notice. Check refugee status regularly Those who are recognized or provisionally admitted as refugees should have their status regularly reviewed. Those who travel to their home region for vacations or other reasons are apparently no longer persecuted. Consequently, refugee status with all privileges must be immediately revoked and expulsion ordered or re-entry denied. In addition, the conclusion of readmission agreements is to be given a high priority. States that do not take back their citizens expelled by Switzerland should not receive development aid. Diplomacy must be clearly put at the service of the country's interests. Implement rejections immediately Persons whose applications for asylum have been rejected or whose refugee status has been revoked must be returned to their home country as quickly as possible. In the period prior to removal, these persons should only receive emergency aid in kind. Anyone who resists expulsion is to be taken into custody and deported by force. The cantons must be better supported, but also held accountable. Lax deportation practices or the continuation of social assistance payments to persons with a deportation decision by certain cantons is detrimental to the country's interests and must therefore be stopped. Viewpoints The SVP ... wants economic migrants to be consistently sent back so that those who are genuinely persecuted can be helped; calls for consistent implementation of current asylum laws and speedy decisions; calls for local help to be the priority for war refugees; calls for consistent enforcement of the Dublin Agreement so that people from safe third countries no longer receive asylum procedures; wants the borders to be structurally reinforced and controls intensified; Demands that scientific methods for determining the age of allegedly underage asylum seekers be applied consistently and without gaps; demands the possibility of identifying asylum seekers by evaluating communication devices; demands controlled centers for ongoing asylum procedures and closed centers for recalcitrant and delinquent asylum seekers; demands the reduction of support benefits for asylum seekers at all levels; demands that support benefits for rejected asylum seekers be limited to the necessities of life; demands a ban or demands a ban orrestriction on family reunification; demands that refugees who travel to their home country lose their right of residence in Switzerland immediately; demands that asylum seekers, ""sans papiers"" and temporarily admitted persons be insured in a separate health insurance fund with a reduced list of basic benefits for the purpose of cost transparency; demands that asylum seekers who have committed a crime be immediately excluded from the asylum process and rejected; demands the rapid repatriation of temporarily admitted persons and thus no integration into the labor market. Advantages This brings me:as a human being, the guarantee that Switzerland offers refuge to genuinely persecuted people, true to its humanitarian tradition; as a taxpayer, a lower burden due to cost savings in the asylum system and the associated social expenditures ; as a citizen, the certainty that our state will not allow itself to be ripped off by economic migrants; in everyday life, more security, because drunken loitering and petty crime are no longer worthwhile for asylum seekers and violent crime is severely punished. Security, law and order Victim protection instead of offender protection Switzerland was once one of the safest countries in the world. Loose policies, inconsistent implementation of existing laws, and the opening of borders through Switzerland's accession to the ""Schengen"" area led to our country being one of the high crime states in Europe today. However, Switzerland must not become an Eldorado for criminals. A policy with tangible penalties and consistent enforcement must finally be implemented. Uncertainty is growing Every thirteen minutes, burglars entered an apartment or house somewhere in Switzerland in 2017. For every 100,000 inhabitants, there were just under 500 burglaries in the same year. This means that Switzerland has been the number one target country in Europe for professional gangs and thieves for years. This has a direct impact on citizens' perception of safety. Many people no longer feel safe in our country. Older people, but also women, do not dare to go out on the street after dark. Young people, especially young women, are touched, threatened or even attacked when they go out. Refusal of a political mandate In 2010, the people and the cantons approved the SVP popular initiative to deport criminal foreigners. However, the Federal Council and Parliament have watered down the clear mandate of the sovereign during implementation with a ""hardship clause"". This means that the courts can continue to decide for themselves when a criminal should be deported. The voters rejected the enforcement initiative launched by the SVP, relying on the promises of the left and the bourgeoisie that the deportation initiative would be implemented ""as hard as nails"" and that the ""hardship clause"" would only be applied in very rare exceptional cases. However, as the SVP already predicted during the parliamentary debate, the deportation figures unfortunately indicate that criminals will continue not to be deported. The ""hardship clause"" thus turns out to be a ""perpetrator protection clause"". Young people in danger Our criminal justice system is ailing in various areas today. On the one hand, sentences are too lenient, especially for violent crimes. Many judges do not exhaust the possible range of punishment. Too many lenient sentences and lax enforcement ensure that the necessary deterrent effect is lacking. Another problem is that the procedures are sometimes far too long. Our criminal law is now heavily geared to finding a sanction for offenders that is accommodating and offers help, which gives greater weight to the therapeutic effect than to the punitive and deterrent character. In the process - especially in the case of violent crimes - the victim is forgotten. Tighter measures are also needed in the area of juvenile criminal law. Word has spread in organized crime circles that 17-year-old offenders face significantly lighter sentences and sanctions, which is why more children are being recruited to commit crimes. Zero tolerance for violence The SVP is calling for significantly higher penalties for violent crimes, especially in cases where police officers or civil servants are attacked. In criminal law, only harsh sanctions can have a deterrent effect. In order to limit the judge's room for maneuver, minimum sentences are therefore increasingly appropriate. Juvenile criminal law, which applies to underage offenders, urgently needs to be tightened. The judiciary must be given the opportunity to apply adult criminal law to offenders who are minors. There is also a need to move away from expensive, therapy-heavy prisons. Detention should not be a wellness stay. Control borders Switzerland needs to control the borders again as it did before joining ""Schengen"". A country that opens its borders uncontrolled and is no longer allowed to carry out systematic border controls forfeits an essential element of its sovereignty and puts its security at risk. Foreign gangs of thieves are organizing regular raids through our country. Yet, year after year, we spend more taxpayer money on the non-functioning ""Schengen"" agreement. While the Federal Council spoke of costs of around CHF 8 million before the referendum on the ""Schengen"" agreement, ""Schengen"" is already costing us a three-digit million sum every year (and rising). It is undisputed that complete border control is not possible. However, it has a deterrent effect that should not be underestimated if a check must be expected when crossing the border. It is not surprising that crimes are committed by criminal tourists at the borders and in villages and towns along the highways. Shortly after the crime, the delinquents are out of the country again. Switzerland must also once again decide independently on the issuing of visas and not blindly accept Schengen visas. Viewpoints The SVP ... demands that the interests of the victims are consistently given higher priority than those of the perpetrators; calls for swift and consistent action to be taken against violent criminals for the safety of the population; calls for the minimum sentence for offenses against life and limb to be increased and for judges to make use of the scope for longer sentences in the Criminal Code; demands that the statute of limitations for life sentences be increased from the current 30 years to no statute of limitations; demands a criminal record in which serious offenses are not deleted so that repeat offenses can be prevented; supports tougher sentences and swift action by the courts, especially in juvenile criminal law; calls for a rethink in the prison system: less therapy, more work and participation in the costs incurred; wants nationalities and migration backgrounds to be shown in federal crime statistics; calls for the ""Schengen"" agreement to be consistently applied by states with ""Schengen"" external borders; calls for Switzerland to make use of its right under the Schengen Agreement to reintroduce border controls in order to prevent illegal immigrants and criminal tourists from entering the country; calls for the consistent application of the Intelligence Services Act in the fight against terrorism and cybercrime. Advantages This gives me:as a citizen security against burglaries and thefts; as a teenager, less pick-up lines and bullying when going out; As a victim of violence, you can be sure that the perpetrators will be taken off the streets; As a judge and police officer, I need an effective legal basis in order to be able to really take action in cases of crime. Army Security for our population Security is an indispensable prerequisite for freedom, independence and prosperity. A credible, strong militia army guarantees this security even in times of crisis and is the tailor-made solution for Switzerland's needs. Safety cannot be taken for granted. Today, armed conflicts are raging just a few hours' flight away from us. Terrorist attacks are possible anytime and anywhere. We are obliged to continue to provide the necessary resources for our armed forces and national defense in the future - so that the people of Switzerland can live in security and freedom. Army as insurance With its militia army, Switzerland defends the country and its people from any violent external threat. Perpetual armed neutrality has preserved our country's independence, peace and freedom. The army secures life and limb, property and living space for citizens in times of crisis, but also direct democratic rights as the supreme sovereign authority. A country that cannot or will not provide for its own security is no longer sovereign. The army is the last resort in the defense of our freedom. That is why this last resort must never fail. Wars are unfortunately a fact of life There is no sign of eternal peace breaking out among the nations. On the contrary, tensions and armed conflicts continue to be a global issue. Violence and war remain preferred means in the global struggle for power, raw materials, religious or ideological influence. National interests also shape the actions of the major powers. The independent guarantee of defense readiness remains crucial for our sovereignty in the small state of Switzerland. Within the framework of a serious security policy, a realistic threat picture must be determined on the basis of a realistic world view. A realistic assessment requires us to expect surprises and imponderables. Effective protection of the country and its people does not tolerate half-measures and compromises. Switzerland is vulnerable In view of the power struggle for resources and transport routes, our transit axes remain the focus of our strategic interests. Religiously motivated violence and terror - which have become increasingly visible with radical Islamism in recent years - occupy not only spaces, but also minds. The Internet in particular offers a largely uncontrollable platform for spreading radical ideas far beyond national borders in a short time and with little effort. There is an increased terrorist threat from non-state actors or cyber attacks. This has been impressively demonstrated by various events, including in the immediate vicinity of Switzerland. Even if Switzerland is unlikely to become the main target of aggression, hostile actions and terrorist attacks are always possible. As a country with great prosperity, Europe's water castle, a hub for international commodity trading and an important financial center, Switzerland still has much to defend. Sufficient resources for a credible army The SVP wants a modernly equipped and well-trained defensive army that defends independence and shows Switzerland as a predictable neutral state contributing to peace. With the resources of 5 billion Swiss francs per year decided by the parliament, with a stock of 100,000 members of the armed forces, the mission cannot be fulfilled, which includes not only defense but also the support of civilian authorities (e.g. in disaster relief). The bleeding of the army through further cuts in army spending must be stopped. Compared with countries such as Sweden, Austria and Finland, Switzerland spent the least on the armed forces as a percentage of gross domestic product. From the SVP's point of view, funds of at least CHF 5.4 billion per year and a target number of at least 140,000 army personnel are indispensable. A maximum number of working days per year should not be specified. The refresher course should generally last three weeks. Independent defense without alternative Guaranteeing the security of the country and its people is a core task of the state. That is why we need a strong and effective army with a concrete mission, binding goals and a realistic strategy. The members of the armed forces must be able to be called up within a few days and be operational around the clock for a period to be defined. A reconstruction of the army after the completion of the ""WEA"" (further development of the army) is urgent. The first step is to quickly and comprehensively implement the ongoing ""WEA"" project as a basis, to create an updated security policy report as a basis for comprehensive security and to continuously update this report with additional reports. In addition, the needs of the armed forces as the most important means of security policy are to be reviewed and defined in an army report as a basis for reconstruction. No foreign missions and military alliances The army has to leave the disastrous path of internationalization. Swiss soldiers, as members of the army of a neutral small state, have no business abroad. The neutrality policy maxim attributed to Nicholas of Flüe, ""Do not interfere in foreign affairs,"" needs to be given more attention again. Foreign deployments, such as the one in Kosovo, must be ended. Our army must not be led into NATO, nor integrated into the EU's common defense policy. In addition, the tendency to further reduce the size of the army and to gradually transform it into a professional army must be stopped. Management structures and bloated staffs must be further and noticeably streamlined. A powerful army also needs a well-equipped air force that is capable of fending off threats in the air. It is therefore essential that the renewal of the Air Force be taken in hand. Viewpoints The SVP ... is committed to an excellently trained militia army and to universal conscription; advocates fully equipped ground forces and a modern air force to protect the people of Switzerland; calls for a modern army that can quickly adapt to the challenges of the day, especially in the area of cyber security and hybrid warfare; opposes any further reduction in the army budget or the number of army personnel. The financing and the existence of the army must ensure the defense of our country and the population at all times; demands a high level of readiness of the army, graduated according to the threat ; demands an end to armed foreign missions such as the one in Kosovo; stands for an alliance-free Switzerland and no further integration into NATO; calls for a balanced presence of the armed forces in all regions of Switzerland; advocates the preservation of an independent, liberal weapons law; calls for the abolition of civilian service and the integration of conscripted people into the armed forces or civil defense; calls for the units of the armed forces not to be further reduced in favor of army administration. Advantages That gives me:as a citizen more security; as a family, the certainty that our country can be protected; As a member of the armed forces, we have the necessary resources to fully fulfill our mission for the country and its people; As a responsible member of the public authorities, I always have the right tools to deal with crises and disasters; As parents, we want to be certain that our sons and daughters will not have to go off to fight in foreign wars. Social Works Safeguarding social services - combating abuses Our social services help citizens who are in need and make an important contribution to social peace. Since in the past the structural problems and the potential for abuse of the social security system were always covered up with taxpayers' money, it is all the more urgent today to restore the balance and solidarity between old and young, between the genuinely needy and the premium and tax payers. Responsible solutions require a consistent policy. The financial security of AHV pensions is a must. Problems covered up with money Center-left policies have led to a failure to honestly address obvious abuses in social services, abuse and structural underfunding. People turned a blind eye to the real problems. Grievances were usually casually covered up with more money - money that was collected from citizens and companies with additional taxes and levies. Pension provision in difficulties We are getting older and are therefore drawing pensions for longer and longer. The result is that fewer and fewer working people have to pay for more and more pensioners. Whereas in 1970 there were still five working people paying in for one pensioner, today there are only three. The AHV is already taking in less than it is paying out. The calculation no longer works. The SVP wants to change that and secure AHV pensions for the Swiss - and without new taxes and levies. This includes, in particular, the equalization of the retirement age for men and women and a redirection of asylum and development aid funds to the AHV. Welfare state reaches its limits The welfare state is increasingly reaching its limits. While total spending on social security was less than 2 billion francs in 1950 and rose to 62 billion francs by 1990, spending on social welfare in Switzerland was no less than 177 billion francs in 2016. Thus, social benefits accounted for a quarter of national GDP. The welfare state is growing over our heads at the expense of future generations. Fewer and fewer contributors have to pay for more and more recipients. The welfare state is being called into question: AHV, supplementary benefits, unemployment insurance, pension fund, income replacement scheme, disability insurance, maternity insurance and, as a last safety net, social assistance - none of these social institutions is soundly financed. For example, social welfare spending in 2017 was over CHF 2.8 billion. This corresponds to an increase of over one billion Swiss francs within just ten years. More and more people are receiving social assistance for longer and longer. Social assistance has lost its original function as bridging assistance and help for self-help. Centralization and professionalization tendencies have also led to systems becoming increasingly distant from the people concerned, making it more difficult to provide effective and dignified assistance. This applies not only to social welfare, but also, for example, to child and adult protection, whose centralization in the form of the so-called KESB has led to a deterioration of the situation. Reforms are inevitable The SVP is committed to the long-term financial security of social welfare systems. It is aware that every franc that can be used for this purpose must first be earned. This requires reforms to be based on facts and realistic scenarios. The SVP therefore advocates the same retirement age of 65 for women as for men. In the case of occupational pensions, the SVP is in favor of depoliticizing technical variables such as the minimum conversion rate or the minimum interest rate so that the actual economic conditions are taken into account and political sensitivities do not influence the calculation of these variables. Eliminate disincentives Furthermore, the announced reforms to the IV must be implemented. The proportion of foreigners in the IV has long been disproportionately high compared to the proportion in the overall population. The pension scale needs to be refined. The export of IV pensions abroad without adjustment for purchasing power must be stopped. More rigorous review is needed for mental disorders that are now frequently diagnosed. Performance impairment and readiness tests must be the order of the day to prevent misuse and misdiagnosis. Social welfare must not be a hammock In the cantons, social welfare legislation must be designed in such a way that social welfare can no longer be exploited and abused. Those who do not make an effort to integrate and work should not receive any help. Work must be worthwhile. The guidelines of the Swiss Conference for Social Welfare (SKOS) are to be regarded as non-binding orientation aids for the implementing bodies and are accordingly to be designated as such in the cantonal social assistance and welfare laws and ordinances. This is because the SKOS calculates with ideologically motivated overestimates. Anyone who refuses reasonable work or otherwise fails to comply with the authorities' regulations should be subject to a significant reduction in benefits. Further professionalization in the welfare system must be vigorously opposed. Instead, the militia principle, municipal autonomy and proximity to citizens should be strengthened, as this is the only way to provide appropriate, affordable and dignified assistance in specific individual cases. Family, local associations, churches and companies should be able to make their important contribution. Viewpoints The SVP ... advocates the financial stabilization of social welfare systems and rejects the expansion of the welfare state; rejects any increase in taxes and contributions for the restructuring of our social welfare systems; advocates the permanent fight against abuse in the social insurance systems; calls for a minimum contribution period in all social welfare systems in order to prevent the erosion of the welfare state through poverty immigration; demands to safeguard the AHV: Retirement age 65 for women and men Full use of the additional VAT percentage levied since 1999 for the AHV Repayment of disability insurance debts to the AHV moderate and gradual increase in the retirement age, adapted to rising life expectancy or the shortfall in the AHV reserve fund calls for a shift of funds from asylum and development aid to the AHV; calls for AHV pensions to be exempt from federal tax and other taxes; combats the cross-subsidization of pension funds from employees to pensioners; calls for the municipalities to have a say in the area of child and adult protection and for family solutions to be given preference over institutional solutions; demands a rethink of the social welfare system: The principle of militia over more centralization and further expansion of the state; the autonomy of the municipalities in the welfare system must be strengthened; integration before social assistance, social assistance is bridging assistance; the binding nature of the SKOS guidelines must be removed from the cantonal social assistance laws; fight the unaffordable consequences in social assistance resulting from a wrong asylum and immigration policy. That brings me:as a pensioner secure pensions; as a young person, the prospect of having secure social security in the long term; as a person in need, the security of not being worse off because of the abuses of others; as a consumer, no increase in VAT for social services; As a municipal politician, I have the opportunity to act as required in every situation; As a trader, you do not have to pay any additional taxes or charges. Health Quality thanks to competition Our healthcare system is one of the best in the world, but also one of the most expensive. The increasing nationalization of the healthcare system is causing desires and premiums to rise continuously. In order to put a stop to this development, misaligned incentives in the current system must be eliminated. Personal responsibility must be strengthened. The paternalism of the citizen under the pretext of health promotion must be stopped. Limits must be placed on the Federal Office of Public Health's (FOPH) rampant activities. Over-regulated healthcare sector A society that is living longer and longer and medical advances that are opening up more and more treatment options are factors that are leading to ever greater consumption of medical services. Combined with mandatory insurance, it is clear that the demand for healthcare services will remain high in the future. Further expansion of the state in this area would not slow down the development of costs, but make the situation worse. Sprawling catalog of services Health insurance is no longer a matter of an individual contract between the patient and their insurer, but of a catalog of benefits defined by the authorities. Instead of the doctor and patient, the state determines which treatment is ""effective"", ""appropriate"" and ""economical"". In view of this excessive demand, politicians know nothing better than to constantly expand the catalog of benefits with ever new, pleasing offers. In the growing supply and demand, it has become difficult to say no. But patients, doctors, the pharmaceutical industry and medical technology companies also want to place their wishes and services in the catalog. This rampant coverage of every health risk and every individual need leads to a fully comprehensive insurance mentality on the part of the population, in which all personal responsibility is lost. Expensive prevention mania The nationalization of the healthcare system and the resulting bureaucracy have led to ever-increasing costs. The FOPH alone now costs over 3 billion francs a year. The budget of this federal office, which pays princely average salaries of 135,000 francs a year, is expected to grow by more than 100 million francs annually by 2021. This massive growth in expenditure is justified, among other things, by the ever-increasing number of regulations, compliance with which must be monitored - regulations, incidentally, that were introduced precisely by the FOPH itself. FOPH health officials want to use laws and expensive campaigns to help society live a supposedly good and healthy life. Tobacco and alcohol will be followed by laser, light and sound, and later probably sugar, fat or meat as targets of an actual prevention mania. More and more money is flowing into dubious and ideologically motivated studies and educational campaigns. Eliminate disincentives The SVP is fighting against the further centralization and nationalization of the healthcare system. Further state intervention, new laws, supervisory bodies and centralized powers at federal level must be prevented, as they are already hindering competition and creating false incentives. Instead of relying on the responsible citizen, the health apostles at the FOPH want to intervene in the health policy competencies of the cantons. This must not be. At the same time, the role of the cantons must be redefined and limited to essential tasks of supervision and control. The SVP therefore advocates a clear division of roles and a reduction in conflicts of interest. In this sense, the hospitals are to become independent, the tariff issues are to be negotiated by the tariff partners and, if necessary, approved by an independent judicial authority. Strengthen personal responsibility Competition and freedom of contract must also act as basic principles in the healthcare sector and must therefore be strengthened. The personal responsibility of the insured, i.e. also their cost sharing, must be increased and an exaggerated attitude of entitlement prevented. The personal relationship and the direct responsibilities derived from it between doctor and patient, between pharmacist and customer or also between insurance company and insured person must be in the foreground. The SVP therefore advocates the creation of a basic benefits catalog limited to the essential health needs in the compulsory insurance, which can be supplemented by freely selectable benefits financed by supplementary insurance. Asylum seekers and temporarily admitted persons must be treated outside the KVG system and directly at the expense of the federal government or the cantons. Stopping the academization of the nursing professions The current shortage of nursing staff is also the result of poor decisions in the education sector. For the SVP, it is incomprehensible how higher quality and quantity can be achieved by academizing the nursing professions. An academic title proves a theoretically oriented education, but says nothing about quality for the benefit of patients. There is a need to strengthen the various practice-based nursing education professions. In addition, the training of the next generation of local physicians must be promoted. Viewpoints The SVP ... stands for a liberal healthcare system that guarantees high-quality and efficient healthcare; calls for more transparency with regard to quality and prices in the healthcare system in order to strengthen patients' freedom of choice; calls for the consistent avoidance of superfluous benefits in order to slow down premium growth; advocates freedom of contract between health insurers and service providers; is committed to ensuring that treatment errors are not paid for by patients or premium and tax payers, but by those responsible; calls for the freely selectable deductibles of the KVG basic insurance to be adjusted in order to strengthen personal responsibility; is committed to ensuring that a share of the cost price is charged in cash for each new treatment case for outpatient visits to the practice or hospital; demands that ""sans-papiers"" and rejected asylum seekers are not subject to compulsory health insurance, including premium reductions, but are only covered in emergencies; defends itself against questionable and expensive campaigns by the authorities under the guise of prevention; rejects the legalization and trivialization of drugs; combats the nursing care crisis by advocating the increased involvement of neighborly help, support for relatives, voluntary work and innovative forms of care in long-term care and promoting them with tax incentives; advocates tax incentives so that end-of-life care can be chosen and financed independently; combats bureaucracy in the healthcare sector so that more time can be devoted to patients again; is committed to ensuring that inpatient and outpatient treatments are financed uniformly; is committed to the rapid nationwide introduction of electronic patient records in order to exploit the associated efficiency gains for the benefit of premium and tax payers; demands that basic health insurance premiums should be fully tax-deductible; supports the goal of ensuring that healthcare expenditure does not grow faster than the wages of premium payers. Advantages This provides me:as a patient with high-quality care; as an insured person affordable health insurance premiums; as a resident of a peripheral region health care providers in the surrounding area; as a doctor, the free exercise of my profession without increasing state paternalism. Agriculture For domestic production The SVP is committed to a productive agricultural sector that supplies the population with healthy food produced close to the market. Farm families must earn a reasonable income for their important services to the community. The planning security and innovative strength of an entrepreneurial agriculture must be strengthened. To this end, excessive ecologization and bureaucracy must be reduced to a reasonable level. The cultivated land shall be taken care of in return and it shall be adequately preserved. Death of farmers continues One hundred years ago, there were over 243,000 farms in Switzerland; in 1990, there were 108,000; in 2017, there were just 51,620. With this ongoing, negative structural change, the number of employees also declined drastically. In 2017, there were still 153,864 people, a decrease of around 25 percent in 18 years. The population supports the farming community and assigns it important tasks through the Federal Constitution and the Law on Agriculture. For the success of the future agricultural policy, it is therefore also necessary that the will of the people and the provisions on food security are consistently implemented. The mission is crystal clear: stop the one-sided prioritization of ecology in agriculture, no further opening of borders, the improvement of framework conditions and thus the strengthening of domestic production of healthy food. However, due to the current agricultural policy, farmers are less and less able to fulfill their constitutional mandate: Excessive regulatory mania, for example in spatial planning, building and environmental law, is taking its toll on production agriculture. The preservation of the highest possible degree of self-sufficiency, as well as the management and maintenance of the cultivated landscape, is thus acutely endangered. Self-sufficiency level must not fall any further Switzerland is already one of the world's largest net importers of food per capita. While we import around CHF 600 worth of food per inhabitant per year, this figure is around ten times lower in the EU. The net self-sufficiency rate (imported feed for domestic livestock production deducted) was 59 percent in 2000 and has since fallen below 50 percent. Switzerland is therefore a long way from being self-sufficient. In the SVP's view, efficient family businesses with sustainable structures should be promoted in any case. Productive agriculture Our production agriculture offers the most efficient and most favorable option for maintaining a diverse and well-structured cultural landscape. This makes more ecological sense than transporting agricultural products, which can be produced here with Swiss quality, across continents. With its current agricultural policy, however, Switzerland has taken exactly the opposite path. In other words, extensive agriculture is promoted at the expense of production agriculture. So we are doing exactly what we should not be doing: First, we are importing more and more food without knowing the production conditions, while second, we are also increasing our dependence on foreign countries. In addition, more and more valuable agricultural land is falling victim to deforestation and the renaturation of bodies of water. Due to high immigration, the settlement area is growing at the expense of cultivated land. Do not sacrifice farmers on the altar of free trade The agricultural free trade agreements sought by the Federal Council, which envisage a far too extensive opening of borders in the agricultural sector, would have consequences that threaten the existence of local farming families. Lowering food prices to EU or even world market price levels - with production costs remaining virtually unchanged - would destroy the existence of a domestic agricultural sector. This in turn would have a negative impact on decentralized settlement, the maintenance of the cultural landscape and the safety and quality of food. The SVP therefore rejects uncontrolled agricultural free trade. Sensible spatial planning The Spatial Planning Act must be geared towards enabling entrepreneurial farmers to develop their businesses in a future-oriented and market-oriented manner. The SVP is committed to spatial planning that allows for flexible and complete use of existing buildings and facilities outside the building zone. This protects cultivated land, preserves the landscape and ensures added value in rural areas. The SVP is committed to the economical use of agricultural land. In addition, sustainable farms should continue to be allowed to construct new farm buildings that conform to zoning regulations, and this without restrictions on ownership. Less agricultural bureaucracy, clean drinking water and protection from large predators The SVP also opposes the constant expansion of directives and regulations in animal, water and environmental protection, which cause ever higher costs and a disproportionate administrative burden. In connection with the quality of the water supply, it must be noted that the Swiss drinking water quality is excellent in a global comparison and is of central importance for agriculture. The SVP takes the challenges around drinking water quality very seriously. For the SVP it is also clear that large predators have no place in our densely populated country. The welfare of various livestock and the preservation of rare breeds should be given more weight than large predators such as the wolf or the bear. Viewpoints The SVP ... calls for the preservation of food security in Switzerland through a level of self-sufficiency of at least 60 percent; fights to secure the livelihood of family farms; wants to strengthen agricultural businesses and minimize administrative requirements; opposes the passing on of additional agricultural policy costs to the cantons; relies on domestic production, processing and marketing and rejects free trade in agriculture; is fighting against ever new regulations in animal, water and environmental protection, which lead to higher costs and administrative complications; is committed to spatial planning that allows flexible and complete use of existing buildings and facilities outside the building zone; fights for investment security by ensuring that buildings and facilities built in accordance with the latest findings and regulations no longer have to be modified or adapted during their depreciation period; advocates targeted support measures for livestock farming to strengthen productive grassland farms; demands that the absolute protection of forests be relaxed in favor of the preservation of cultivated land; defends itself against ""agricultural policy experiments"" under the guise of ""drinking water quality"", which is already excellent by international standards; supports rapid intervention by the cantons to eliminate problematic large carnivores in consultation with the Confederation. In the longer term, Switzerland must be kept free of large carnivores. Advantages This brings me:as a consumer, healthy food from local production; prospects for the future as a farming family; as a farmer the necessary entrepreneurial freedom; as a hiker and tourist a well-kept cultural landscape; As a nature-loving person, I love a beautiful and intact landscape. Traffic Fighting traffic jams and chicanes on the road Mobility is regarded as a driver of the economy and trade, as well as a guarantor of prosperity. The transport infrastructure is therefore not only a success factor and locational advantage, but also a calling card for our country. Permanent congestion situations on the road network are an indictment of a progressive country. Since 2007, roads have been neglected compared to railways, while each year an average of over 70,000 more people (as of 20072018) have immigrated to Switzerland, putting additional strain on our roads. If you want so many people in our small country, you have to provide them with the infrastructure. And that didn't happen with road traffic. Result: daily, crippling traffic jams. Since 2007, the national roads have not even received the funds needed for decent maintenance. As a result, the overall condition of roadways and pavements deteriorated due to the additional load. This must change immediately. Road must no longer be disadvantaged compared to rail. Because in our neighboring countries, it's the other way around. There, the majority of trade and thus the economy is based almost exclusively on the road network. Switzerland is in danger of putting its money for transport infrastructure on the wrong card. Because with electromobility and self-driving vehicles, the road is likely to become even more important in the future. Redistribution, cross-subsidization and misappropriation must be stopped, as well as the robbery of motorists through ever new and higher taxes, fees and excessive bus concepts. The handbrake must also finally be released on air traffic, which is vital to the economy and tourism. The SVP is therefore committed to improving the framework conditions for aviation through sensible and business-friendly measures and agreements, as well as a reduction in requirements and regulations. Transport network lags behind The enormous growth in traffic over the last few decades poses major challenges for our infrastructure. Bottlenecks are occurring in many places. This is also reflected in the increase in congestion hours on the entire road network in recent years. However, the most congestion, obstructions and accidents occur on the main axes. In the meantime, not only the trade and the economy suffer from it, but also tourism. If this continues, our country will suffer great damage. One-sided transport policy On the one hand, this state of affairs is the result of economic growth, increasing mobility and high immigration. On the other hand, it is also the result of a one-sided transport policy pursued by the Federal Council and Parliament. Optimizing traffic flows through traffic management measures (use of breakdown lanes, temporary speed reductions, passing on the right, temporary truck overtaking bans) can alleviate problems, but only temporarily. In view of the forecast growth rates, no one can avoid a far-reaching expansion of the road infrastructure in Switzerland. Because electric cars and self-driving vehicles also roads and parking spaces. Eliminate bottlenecks The Swiss pay more and more for the need to drive (taxes and duties), but receive less and less in return. The overriding goal must be to eliminate the most important bottlenecks immediately with the available funds and to carry out expansions where the load is greatest. With the FABI (for rail) and NAF (for roads) funds, the federal government has the means to do so. The SVP is committed to ensuring that the financial resources of the NAF for roads are properly prioritized and not diverted on a large scale to agglomeration transport (public transport and bicycle projects). The only criteria that apply are economic efficiency, urgency and demand from transport users. Terror of fines and fees at the expense of motorists In some cantons, drivers are being ripped off by a scandalous system of fines. The supposedly increased safety of road users turns out to be a pretext in view of the firmly budgeted revenue from fines. The development over the years shows a steady increase in these revenues. This is bus terror at the expense of motorists. As if this were not enough, the SVP has to constantly defend itself against new levies and charges in road transport, e.g. mobility pricing, higher fuel charges, increasing the price of vignettes, CO2 levies, etc. While other road users can benefit from more and more infrastructure for free (e.g. cyclists) or heavily subsidized (public transport users), car drivers are being asked to pay more and more. This one-sided raid against motorists must finally be stopped. Stop SBB's megalomania billions of Swiss francs flow into public transport. SBB benefits the most. This has expensive consequences. Personnel costs at SBB grew by more than 25 percent (plus 1 billion francs) in just ten years (20062016). However, the capacity utilization of the trains is still too low. When it comes to real estate, we're making a big splash. The SBB headquarters in Berne and various new station buildings are proof that SBB has long since left the path of self-restraint and modesty. The competition of private parties by SBB, on the real estate market and in other areas outside the core mandate, must be stopped. The SVP is calling for more competition on the Swiss rail network, for example from private railroads such as BLS or SOB, not only for cheaper ticket prices, but above all so that the operating costs of the railroads can finally be compared and come under pressure. Principles of the SVP transport policy Each mode of transportation gets the funds it generates (via previous taxes, fees, etc.). This principle effectively puts a stop to misappropriation and cross-subsidization. Any increase in existing levies and the introduction of new levies must be subject to an optional referendum. The accounting of the individual modes of transport must be placed on a transparent and comprehensible basis. The economic viability of the modes of transport must be improved. The aim must be for the modes of transport to be able to finance themselves without state subsidies in the medium term. This also requires more competition on the railways. Viewpoints The SVP ... says no to tunnel fees, mobility pricing, CO2 taxes on fuel, e-vignette, increase in the price of the highway vignette and increases in the HVF; fights the constant adoption of EU law in transport; is opposed to any discrimination against modes of transport and is in favor of free choice of transport; calls for an end to the cross-subsidization of the railways through charges and levies on road traffic; is opposed to traffic fines, which are obviously not focused on the safety of citizens but on state revenue; calls for the excesses of the ""Via sicura"" regulations to be corrected and the criminalization of road users to be ended; is fighting for a general speed limit of 50 km/h on main roads and major thoroughfares in urban areas; is open to new types of drive (electric, gas, hydrogen, hybrid, etc.), but opposes state subsidies for them and rejects bans on petrol or diesel engines; supports new forms of mobility such as autonomous cars, trucks and buses as well as business models at the interface between mobility and the Internet; rejects a relaxation of the existing ban on cabotage in the transportation of goods and passengers by road; wants transparency in the construction and follow-up costs of infrastructure projects by including economic efficiency as the primary criterion; calls for the completion of the expansion of the Lötschberg railroad tunnel; requires a higher degree of cost recovery in rail transport; calls for the current operating hours at Swiss airports to be maintained and for the approval of moderate capacity improvements (fast taxiways, optimized approach and departure procedures, etc.); is fighting CO2 surcharges and government levies on airline tickets. Advantages This brings me:as a car driver more safety, less congestion, no new taxes and fewer state levies when refueling; less crowded trains and a free choice of rail company; As a transporter, I have sufficient road and rail capacity and the guarantee that my products will reach the customer on time; enjoy Switzerland as a tourist and not spend hours stuck in traffic jams; As an employee of an international company, I have reliable connections all over the world. Energy For an energy supply with a future Without energy, the world stands still. Energy is needed for all areas of human life, be it for the production of goods, for daily work or for leisure. Switzerland currently has a functioning, secure and inexpensive energy supply with strong domestic electricity production. However, the adoption of the Energy Act in 2017 will change this situation. Dangerous experiment The new energy law aims to reduce energy consumption with a series of measures. Thus, in addition to more subsidies for renewable energy, targets are set to reduce overall energy consumption. This is to be reduced by 43 percent by 2035 compared to the year 2000 - in other words, a practical halving. It is not yet clear what measures will be used to achieve this. Growing energy demand Despite savings measures and greater energy efficiency, energy consumption continues to grow. The growth of the permanent residential population, the economy, mobility as well as the housing stock ensure that our energy demand will continue to increase, not decrease, in the future. To demand a halving of energy consumption from this point of view is completely illusory. Growing costs slow down the trade Rising energy prices and thus higher costs are poison for our country's growth and prosperity. In addition to the increase in production costs and the deterioration in competitiveness, the population thus also has less money at its disposal. Instead of constantly increasing levies and fees, the aim should be to reduce the burden. Instead of more regulations, simplifications should be made. Energy sources are not to be misused as a source of taxation or as an instrument of education, but are to be seen purely as a factor of production. Measures must be practical and must not pursue ideological goals. Harmful subsidies The billions in levies on the various energy sources flow largely into the federal budget. The rest is used to subsidize renewable energies such as wind or solar power - with very moderate success. In 2017, wind and solar renewables accounted for just 2.9 percent of total Swiss electricity production. This is not enough to replace nuclear energy, which accounts for almost 32 percent of the electricity mix. Savings at zero cost? A future-oriented energy policy must be guided by the principles of demand, economic efficiency, independence and environmental friendliness. Efficiency sounds very good, but the reality is that savings are difficult to come by, and certainly not for free. The above-mentioned halving of energy consumption over the next 16 years will focus primarily on reducing fossil fuels. This makes sense from both a supply and environmental perspective. However, it is important to note that the reduction of fossil energies necessarily requires another energy source as a substitute. In other words, replacing an oil-fired heating system with a heat pump or a gasoline-powered car with an electric vehicle inevitably leads to higher electricity consumption and is therefore anything but sustainable. More electricity from own production This also makes it clear that what is needed in the future is not less electricity production, but more. In the interests of improving independence, the majority of this should be expanded domestically. However, this requires electricity that is available at all times and in all weather conditions. Apart from fossil fuels, only hydroelectric and nuclear power can fulfill these requirements. Since existing nuclear power plants in Switzerland may not be replaced by law, the framework conditions for the use of hydropower in particular must be clearly improved. Security of supply as a principle The ultimate goal of a sensible energy policy is cheap, independent, abundant and environmentally friendly energy. This principle is adhered to with the current energy mix. However, these main pillars of our power supply are in danger. The replacement of existing nuclear power plants with new ones is prohibited by law. This accounts for around 32 percent of our domestic electricity production. Hydroelectric power, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of the total, is also in danger due to highly subsidized wind and solar power both at home and abroad. Investments in these energy sources are being delayed or not made at all due to the uncertain situation. The envisaged new incentive schemes for this most important domestic energy source are important, but hardly sufficient for expansion. For a sensible energy policy The energy policy of the future must be based on realistic assumptions and measures and not on ideological and utopian wishful thinking. State and regulatory intervention, such as increasing existing levies and charges and creating new taxes in the energy sector, should be kept to a minimum. Each energy source should participate in the production, according to its advantages. Discrimination or even bans are to be rejected. Instead of an increasingly dense thicket of regulations, more individual responsibility and the reduction of regulations are the order of the day. The economy, but also society, wants to decide for itself which energy sources it wants to give preference to. The overriding goal remains to make our country as independent as possible from foreign countries. Viewpoints The SVP ... wants secure, sufficient and affordable energy for private individuals and businesses; combats the expensive, economically damaging, ideological and restrictive energy policy at federal, cantonal and municipal level; opposes laws and proposals that are unilaterally geared towards protection or subsidies; demands that the energy supply be based on the principles of demand, economic efficiency, independence, environmental friendliness and low emissions; categorically rejects new or higher levies, charges or taxes that make energy more expensive; opposes state incentive and subsidy levies as well as other regulations, provisions and bans in the energy sector, which particularly disadvantage businesses, peripheral regions and the population; advocates the preservation and expansion of domestic electricity production, particularly hydropower; is against technology bans such as a ban on oil heating or a ban on driving petrol or diesel cars; is committed to retaining the tried and tested electricity supply and firmly rejects a politically motivated premature shutdown of existing nuclear power plants and a deterioration in the framework conditions for all energy sources; prefers positive incentives such as tax breaks and investment deductions in the area of renewable energy and increases in energy efficiency to subsidy policy; welcomes private research and realization of projects in the field of new renewable energies such as geothermal, wind and solar energy as well as biomass without new subsidies or compensation. Advantages This provides me:as a consumer with sufficient energy at all times at a favorable price; as an entrepreneur, a secure and affordable energy supply with a high degree of planning and cost certainty; as an environmentally conscious citizen, a low-emission energy supply that is largely independent of foreign countries; As a homeowner, you don't have to worry about new regulations, bans and constraints, which means lower costs; As a resident of a peripheral region, I have sustainable jobs nearby; as a citizen, more independence from foreign countries and international prices and fewer opportunities for blackmail against our country. Environment A livable environment for today and tomorrow An intact environment brings quality of life and well-being. Therefore, it is in everyone's own interest to take care of the environment and thus also of our surroundings. The best way to do this is to act on one's own responsibility and put the findings of science and research into practice. Leftist prohibitionism and fundamentalist state and educational coercion are bad advisors. Voluntariness and healthy moderation are the better recipe. The environment is doing well Our soils and waters are doing just fine. Emissions and pollutants have been decreasing for decades - beautiful nature is one of our country's assets. By implementing the findings of science and technology, this will continue in the future. In contrast to most countries, Switzerland has an extremely poor starting position in many respects. Our geographic location, with many mountains and hilly terrain, provides poor conditions for fuel-efficient vehicles. Our harsh winters and hot summers result in higher energy consumption than the average country. Despite this shortcoming, and despite massive population growth due to immigration (+1.73 million people), increased mobility (60% more vehicles), more economic growth and prosperity (+48% GDP per capita) since 1990, Switzerland is one of the few industrialized countries to meet its international targets. Stop the regulation and prohibition mania This excellent result is no coincidence. Switzerland already has a dense network of environmental laws and regulations. Problems of the past, such as former landfills and storage sites, are being addressed and eliminated with state-of-the-art technology. Here, too, the practical predisposition of our country to analyze a situation first and then to act on its own responsibility and find a solution is evident. Due to the already rigorous legislation, further regulations and bans do not bring any improvement. It would make much more sense to implement the existing rules. Additional government intervention always means costs, which also has a negative impact. After all, only a country with a high level of prosperity and a healthy economy has the means at all to implement the application of new technologies and thus achieve improvements. Against pessimism and ideologies The above-mentioned excellent results, achieved through the efforts of the population and the economy and the already existing dense network of laws in the environmental field, make little impression on the leftist ideologically blinded professional pessimists. With generous media support, they try to give people a guilty conscience by whining and nagging forever. The goal of this doom and gloom is to enforce a policy of government education and coercion, as well as additional bans and even more rip-offs to the detriment of the entire population. Fewer levies and fees The negative environmental drumfire is unfortunately having more and more effect. The new levies and fees introduced over decades in the name of environmental protection - as well as the increase of already existing ones - lead to ever higher costs. In 2016, 11.4 billion Swiss francs were spent on environmental protection - household spending on this area alone increased by a whopping 24% in 8 years. In addition to taxes on fuel, heating oil, waste, water or electricity, other fees such as those for recycling are direct consequences of excessive government regulation. Other levies, such as a bottle or can deposit or driving bans for certain types of vehicles, are proposed in parliament with nice regularity - fortunately so far without success. Especially in the recycling sector, the return rate is excellent and largely without government interference or new systems. More practice, instead of unworldly theories Up to now, the economy and the population have prudently applied the findings of technical progress in practice without state coercion. Entire professions and new job profiles have emerged as a result. This not only had a greater impact than state regulation, punishment and prohibition mania, but also created prosperity. Environmental protection does not need new laws, regulations and more bureaucracy, but more entrepreneurial freedom and the consistent enforcement of existing law. Nor is there any need for unilateral, exaggerated targets such as halving CO2 emissions by 2030 or, in general, for Switzerland to go it alone in environmental and climate policy. This is true not only in the international arena, but especially at home. The realization that problems can be better solved on a small scale than by an all-powerful central state is not new. To ensure that the constitutional competences of the cantons and municipalities, e.g. in spatial planning, are also applied in practice, constant reminders and, above all, vigilance are needed. Role model function of each individual The principle of personal responsibility and voluntariness applies in almost all areas. However, it is indispensable in the environmental sector in particular. The garbage excesses, whether at festivals or barbecues in public parks, are not an outgrowth of too lax laws, but above all an educational problem. With active action by private individuals but also companies, it can be shown in an exemplary manner that environmental protection also works without the state and that no new taxes, subsidies or fee systems are needed. Advantages The SVP ... advocates meaningful efforts to preserve, restore and improve the natural foundations of life; relies on the tried and tested findings and achievements of science, technology and industry to tackle environmental problems; is committed to appropriate measures in the areas of spatial planning, water protection, air pollution control and an independent, economical and environmentally friendly energy policy; opposes the musealization of the landscape through the excessive creation of subsidized nature parks or conservation zones with bureaucratic requirements for agriculture, industry, tourism and affected regions; demands that any unjustified opposition to important construction and infrastructure projects should be subject to full compensation and that the right to lodge complaints with associations and the number of legitimate organizations in this area should be restricted; calls for the Spatial Planning Act to be amended with the aim of giving the cantons back their constitutional authority over spatial planning so that all regions have sufficient development opportunities; firmly rejects Switzerland going it alone when it comes to environmental and climate policy goals such as halving CO2 emissions by 2030 and implementing them without internationally binding decisions by all countries; opposes any new or increased levies, fees and taxes in the area of environmental and climate policy; is in favor of tax incentives in the environmental and climate sector. Advantages This brings me: as a citizen, less ideology and scaremongering as well as lower costs; as a family, an intact and clean environment, also for our descendants; as an investor, more planning security and less bureaucracy in the realization of projects; as a businessman and farmer, fewer requirements and more freedom in my entrepreneurial activities. Media More diversity, less state Independent, free media (press, radio, television, Internet, social media) and competition between individual media providers guarantee a vibrant and functioning democracy. State influence as well as excessive regulation are poison for freedom and diversity of opinion and lead to a monopoly. More competition, a narrow definition of public service, more transparency and fewer legal fetters for private providers characterize a liberal media policy. Direct and indirect state media funding on the rise The media landscape is constantly changing and with it the habits of media consumers. The growing popularity of free print and Internet offerings is not only creating more variety and competition, but is also squeezing traditional media products. Newspapers lose advertisements and readers and thus money. It is interesting that the media that claim to be ""quality media"" are particularly hard hit. This development is called a ""market economy. If there are cheaper, better or more informative media offerings, customers will switch. Generous subsidies and support measures do nothing to change this. On the contrary, these lead to greater state dependency and thus ultimately even to a reduction in media diversity, since many providers, true to the motto ""What bread I eat, that song I sing,"" pass on their patron's message unfiltered and uncritically, thus becoming a state media organ. Misuse of the term ""public service However, this development can be observed not only in the print sector with press subsidies that are no longer up to date, but above all in the television and radio sector. The quasi-monopolist SRG has practically no competition there due to various legislative revisions. The Swiss probably pay the highest radio and television fees in the world. Radio and television were massively expanded under the vague umbrella term ""public service. Every niche was filled with a special-interest program and every target group, no matter how small, was catered for. In connection with the ""No Billag"" referendum, SRG promised in 2018 to reduce its offering and costs. Little happened. On the contrary, SRG is spreading more and more across the Internet. But there are already so many private providers that there is no need for a government-sponsored provider. For more freedom and independence in the media sector A diverse and independent media landscape is central to a functioning democracy. The SVP rejects a new media law that would cement and even expand state subsidies for the media. On the contrary, state media subsidy measures should be abolished and not expanded. The misuse of the term ""public service"" that has been practiced for years must be remedied. A narrow definition is intended to ensure a basic SRG offering in the language regions, namely in the information sector. The remaining programs and topics are to be left to the free market. Reduce radio and TV fees to max. 300 francs This would allow radio and television fees to be reduced to a maximum of 300 francs per year. Companies are to be exempted from this entirely. Public broadcasters should continue to receive license fee money, but they should no longer be allowed to advertise. This is reserved for private providers, but they are not to receive any fee money in return. The use of money from the fee pot for ever new needs, for example to finance the SDA, but also the planned state support of Internet newspapers, must be prevented. Here, the market is already playing without subsidies. More transparency, more freedom With more transparency in SRG's accounting and with the restriction of the basic offering to the information area on radio and television, the state media levies could be massively reduced. All of this would be done without sacrificing subject matter, without sacrificing quality, with more freedom and less government influence - for an independent, vibrant and strong democracy. Viewpoints The SVP ... welcomes an independent and diverse media landscape; demands that the public service financed by fees be limited to services that must be provided and cannot be provided by private companies. This is intended to ensure a basic service in the area of information in the four national languages; calls for a reduction in reception fees to a maximum of CHF 300 per year. companies should be exempted from this; opposes the extension of state subsidies to the SDA as well as to private online news portals and other media; supports the dual system (fees for the public broadcasters, advertising for the private ones); opposes the absolute monopoly position of the SRG and supports the spread of alternative, unfiltered and private communication channels; demands that the revision of the SRG concession be suspended and the existing SRG concession be extended until 2020; fights the spread of one-sided official propaganda; rejects selective advertising bans. All products that are legally available should be allowed to be advertised. Advantages As a consumer, this gives me more choice and better programs at lower fees; as a responsible citizen and voter, less state paternalism and influence; as a media creator, less influence from the state, more freedom and independence; as an entrepreneur, reasonable advertising opportunities for my products at better conditions and no more radio and TV fees in the company. Internet and digitization For a free internet Buzzwords such as ""Industry 4.0"" or the ""Internet of Things"" are shaping the discussion. From robots to drones to self-driving cars, many new achievements are coming our way that call for legal regulation. It's all about security, insurance and contractual issues, copyrights, data protection and potential for abuse. However, in view of the many unanswered questions, there is a risk that the Internet will become overregulated. Two things can slow down or even prevent the progress of digitization and the Internet, namely: government overregulation lack of mobile or wired networks for the required bandwidths. The SVP fights for framework conditions in which digital applications and services can develop - also in the peripheral regions. The main focus here is on modern, secure networks that can transmit large volumes of data. Such networks give Switzerland a locational advantage. In particular, policymakers must do everything in their power to ensure that our country is quickly and comprehensively connected to the 5G mobile network. Because this is the prerequisite for most of the new technical and mobile possibilities. Data Bank Switzerland In the past, many foreigners brought their money to Switzerland because it is safe here. Today, they bring their data to Switzerland because it is safe here. Our country is becoming a successful data center due to its reliable power supply, good telecommunications networks and high security. Billions of data from home and abroad are already stored in our small country. This requires appropriate framework conditions for our IT industry and telecommunications providers. Danger of manipulation of elections and votes One exception is e-voting, i.e. voting via the Internet. Here, the SVP is consistently opposed. Here, manipulations, even from abroad, can never be completely excluded and prevented. Viewpoints The SVP ... is committed to a free and neutral Internet. State intervention may only take place within the framework of the fight against crime and terrorism; supports competition in the telecommunications market, but at the same time also takes care to provide peripheral regions with the latest means of communication as well as secure and reliable networks; promotes the rapid expansion of the fiber optic and 5G mobile network in Switzerland in order to maintain its technological edge over other countries; good framework conditions for the IT industry and, in particular, for Switzerland's success as a data center; advocates ensuring a high level of data protection; opposes the introduction of e-voting in Switzerland; wants to ensure that the protection of (intellectual) property is also guaranteed in the digital world; advocates is committed to ensuring that government services are only digitized (e-government) where costs and bureaucracy for citizens can really be reduced. Advantages This gives me: as a user, the certainty of being able to move freely and unfiltered on the Internet in the future, as long as I stay within the legal area; as an entrepreneur, the advantage of having the best possible networks for Internet and mobile communications available at the respective location, even if I am in a peripheral region; as a voter, the certainty that votes cast cannot be manipulated electronically. Sport Good for body and mind Sporting activity stands for enjoyment, performance and fairness like few other areas of life. The SVP supports grassroots, school, youth and disabled sports and, in particular, voluntary work in sports clubs and competitive sports activities. The framework conditions for sports clubs must be improved, for example, through unbureaucratic, cost-effective options for using public infrastructures. Meaningful, healthy leisure activities Countless Swiss people are involved in individual and team sports in their free time as coaches and club managers. In the clubs and associations, young people learn at an early age to take on responsibility and leadership roles and to be successful as part of a team. Sport forms a meaningful leisure activity and valuable school of life. It encourages achievement and perseverance and gets some young people off the streets. This reduces their risk of slipping into drug addiction or even crime. Sport in school School sports offer a change from sedentary, top-heavy school lessons, while popular or competitive sports provide a balance to everyday working life. However, apart from schooling and infrastructures, sport is not a primary state responsibility. Top-class sport motivates popular sport Top performances by top and competitive athletes motivate young people and broad sections of the population to take part in sports. Athletic talent is to be fostered through a training program that combines school and/or vocational training with professional athletic training. The SVP is committed to fairness and combats match-fixing, doping and violence. Viewpoints The SVP ... welcomes sporting activity to promote enjoyment, performance and fitness; recognizes school sport as an important physical counterbalance to a top-heavy education; requires appropriate support for sports and class camps; is concerned that major obstacles are being placed in the way of even the smallest events by imposing conditions and excessive licensing practices; supports popular sport for health prevention and social integration; calls for unbureaucratic and cost-effective ways of using existing public infrastructure (sports grounds, halls, etc.) for the important work of sports clubs; is committed to the volunteer work carried out in the clubs and the organization of sporting events; is committed to top-class sport and its role model effect for young people and the general public; stands up for fairness and combats doping, betting fraud and violence in the world of sport. Advantages As a recreational athlete, this gives me the opportunity to do sports with the necessary infrastructure; professional training and support as top and competitive athletes; As an employee of a club or association, I have the opportunity to actively promote the interests of sport; As parents, we want to know that our children are being encouraged to do sports at school or in clubs and are not hanging around on the street. Culture Culture is not a task of the state Culture is the multifaceted expression of a diverse society. People have always been the driving force behind cultural activities. Culture is therefore first and foremost an expression of private initiative. State-sponsored culture always runs the risk of paying homage to the zeitgeist and the personal preferences of cultural bureaucrats instead of creating values that are valid for longer and go beyond the topicality of the day. State cultural policy should therefore at most complement private offerings and should be federally organized. No prescribed state culture The more state culture grows, the more living folk culture is lost. State cultural policy often leads to political decision-makers supporting the culture that suits them best politically. This increases the risk of favoritism and haggling. Or else cultural policy becomes funding with a watering can. Either way, culture is a matter of taste. The state has hardly lost anything here. The SVP advocates streamlining the cultural bureaucracy at all levels of government. The potential savings in the area of cultural promotion are likely to amount to several hundred million francs per year. More money - more dependence The cultural message, which sets the guidelines for the federal government's cultural policy, reveals the centralist and statist direction in which the federal government's cultural promotion is to move. Federal spending on culture encourages covetousness and demands on the state, creating dependencies, when cultural practitioners should be independent, driven by their own initiative and passion, living a culture of diversity. The SVP rejects the national cultural policy, which even wants to harmonize the contents of cantonal and communal cultural policy. Switzerland's participation in money-wasting EU cultural programs is rejected by the SVP. Personal initiative creates culture In the opinion of the SVP, culture is fundamentally neither a federal, cantonal nor communal matter. Culture is a matter for those interested in culture. The state should only play a subsidiary role to individual initiative and private funding. Public support for one project always means discrimination against all non-supported projects. This is why the SVP is fighting on the one hand against the expanding cultural bureaucracy and on the other against the one-sided politically driven funding within the framework of current cultural policy. Living culture means diversity By culture, we generally mean what people produce through their actions. Culture requires care in order to be preserved. The liberal, federalist state in particular should aim to create an intellectual climate that enables cultural diversity. Unfortunately, current cultural policy is doing the opposite. Cultural policy must not strive for uniformity, but must allow for diversity. The culture that pleases the public should be the one that succeeds Culture also has a lot to do with the market economy and the laws of supply and demand. A production that bypasses the audience makes no sense. Commercial success should be achieved by culture that appeals to the public. State culture distorts this competition and promotes politically and ideologically motivated projects. Today, our folk culture is hardly supported by the state. It thrives on voluntary work and contributions from individuals, associations and foundations. Culture creates togetherness Amateur theater, amateur orchestras, choral societies, music associations, yodeling clubs, traditional costume groups and even Guggenmusik and rock bands: they all strive less for the praise of art critics than for what culture is essentially about, namely the need to create something together with heart and soul that brings joy to oneself and the audience. This form of culture does not need subsidies, but all the more recognition and a fair starting position. This is also the core of our militia culture. This must be supported. Viewpoints The SVP ... calls for an end to cultural funding based on the watering can principle; demands that outdated cultural structures, such as theaters, be adapted to today's needs and reduced; rejects further centralization of cultural policy within the framework of a national cultural policy; calls for preferential tax treatment or tax exemption for private cultural foundations and donations as well as legal simplifications for the establishment of foundations; wants the museum landscape to be oriented towards the public and thus achieve the highest possible level of self-financing; stands for a folk culture in associations and private structures that is not dependent on the state, but creates local and national culture by citizens for citizens on their own initiative and under their own responsibility; is committed to ensuring that private cultural associations can use public infrastructure as easily and cost-effectively as possible; demands that local traditional culture is given preference over international and prestigious cultural projects that are distant from the people; defends itself against the money-wasting participation in EU cultural programs that are distant from citizens and the economy. Advantages As a person interested in culture, this gives me a diverse rather than a simple offer; more freedom and protection from state influence and monopolization; as a folk musician or amateur actor in the cultural competition. Education Stop out-of-touch reforms, get back to hands-on education An efficient education system is the basis for Switzerland's development and prosperity. The focus is on the well-being of the child as well as his or her holistic development and promotion to become a responsible person for him or herself - and for others. The SVP supports a high-quality, efficient and performance-oriented education system. The school is to be consistently oriented toward practice by focusing on the advancement of head, heart, and hand. Quality depends not only on the use of public finances, but on strong teacher personalities. The dual vocational education system must be strengthened. The SVP is in favor of education being fundamentally the responsibility of parents and education the responsibility of schools, as stipulated in the Federal Constitution. The education system must be geared towards the practical world of work. If more doctors, computer scientists, engineers and technical professionals are needed, they should be trained in Switzerland. When entrepreneurs and secondary schools complain about the lack of basic skills among school leavers, elementary schools must once again focus on regional national language, mathematics and science and, in return, dispense with ideological gender and sex education as well as anti-business ecology and consumer protection lessons. Numerous educational experiments of the last years, e.g. therapeutization, integrative teaching, team teaching, competence orientation, but above all loud reading and writing, ""Bologna"", ""HarmoS"" and the curriculum 21, have brought more bureaucracy, centralism and academization instead of greater practical orientation. They have led to a massive increase in the cost of education and, in many places, to a ""bloating"" of the administrative apparatus (increase in staff), without corresponding benefit. Performance orientation The affirmation of achievement must be part of everyday school life. The sovereignty of the cantons over elementary school is a cornerstone of our education system. The cantons, and thus the citizens, must be able to determine their school system themselves through direct democracy. The cantonal curricula must specify clear and binding learning objectives. Performance and quality must be demanded and promoted at every school level. Without order, discipline and the will to perform, there is no success. Performance assessments must be in the form of grades, behavioral assessments with written evaluations. The report must be clear, meaningful and informative for parents and training companies. Strengthening the teaching profession Teachers must continue to be empowered and given methodological freedom. A return to the tried and tested class teacher system is required at primary level. Teachers should prioritize their full energy and time on teaching and children, not on ""school development"", administration and ""coaching"". The SVP is committed to the autonomy of local schools vis-à-vis the cantonal administrations. The independence and diversity of schools should be respected and granted by the cantonal administration. Strengthening apprenticeships and technical professions By specifically promoting the dual system, the advantages of apprenticeships should be emphasized more strongly and lead to more young people completing a practice-oriented apprenticeship in the future. High baccalaureate rates are only signs of egalitarianism and ultimately of leveling down. Vocational education and training is demonstrably the best guarantee for low youth unemployment and ensures the necessary link between business and education. The SVP is therefore fighting the progressive academization of education. It is committed to ensuring that, for example, primary school teachers do not need a Master's degree, midwives, nurses and kindergarten teachers do not need a university education and that there are no doctorates at universities of applied sciences. Research for top performance Research should not be an end in itself, but should be results- and application-oriented in competition with the best. Swiss universities and the Federal Institutes of Technology must focus on teaching theoretical knowledge, scientific work and cutting-edge research. The courses on offer should be increasingly geared towards the needs of the labor market. The SVP does not want mass universities, but top-class universities. No money for questionable programs It is offensive when Swiss taxpayers finance the education of thousands of foreign students who leave our country after their studies and use their education for the benefit of another business location. Therefore, significantly higher tuition fees must be charged for foreign students. The SVP opposes the money-wasting participation in EU education and research programs that are distant from citizens and the economy. Viewpoints The SVP ... is committed to a high-quality, efficient and performance-oriented education system; requires grades from the first grade; wants the orientation of foreign language teaching to be a matter for the cantons. They are to determine when, which and how many foreign languages are to be taught in their schools; wants to reverse failed educational experiments of recent years (e.g., integrative teaching or phonetic writing); combats the pathologizing of students. Reduce overall percentage of remedial education; calls for violence- and drug-free schools. The prevention of violence and addiction in schools must be given the necessary priority; stands for politically balanced teaching and the teaching and preservation of Swiss cultural values and traditions in public schools; demands that the current national anthem be retained and taught in public schools; combats youth unemployment by strengthening practice-oriented vocational training; does not want the Matura quota to be artificially increased and the entrance examinations at secondary schools to remain in place; calls for periodic reviews and necessary adjustments to the Bologna system with regard to degrees, attractiveness and employability; demands incentives for student loans instead of scholarships and wants scholarships to be consistently reclaimed if students drop out; wants to prevent the expansion of universities of applied sciences into ""cantonal universities"" and thus avoid duplication (no Master's degree courses, no doctoral theses at universities of applied sciences); requires that all lecturers who train prospective teachers at universities of teacher education have themselves worked as classroom teachers for at least three years; demands that private education providers, particularly in the area of continuing education, are not subject to competition from the state. Advantages As a pupil and student, this gives me practical training and good opportunities in the job market; As parents, I want to know that my children are being prepared for the challenges of working life at school; As a teacher, I have the opportunity to concentrate on imparting knowledge instead of spending my time on administrative tasks; apprentices who come out of elementary school with a solid educational background; as head of human resources, well-trained professionals from Switzerland. Religion We stand by our values Switzerland is based on a Christian occidental foundation of culture and values. It is the basis of our identity and our coexistence. It is not without reason that our country bears a cross in its coat of arms and our national anthem refers to God. Freedom of faith and conscience allows all citizens to freely choose their faith, as long as it does not contradict the Swiss legal system. Preserving one's roots The disentanglement of church and state must not obscure the fact that a Christian image of society and man is of great importance for the culture and politics of Switzerland. The loss of these roots and values would be devastating. Individual freedom in particular is a consequence of the Christian view of humanity. The development of democracy from ancient ideas can only be understood in terms of the transition to self-responsibility. Furthermore, the Protestant work ethic is the foundation of an entrepreneurial and performance-oriented society. We draw rational thinking, creativity and innovation from the Christian-Western foundations. After all, entrepreneurship and progress are rooted in active hope for a prosperous future. But the Catholic idea of subsidiarity and the emphasis on the value of the individual within creation were and are also formative for Switzerland and Swiss federalism. Problems should be solved independently and, if possible, by the people concerned. Critically follow the spread of Islam Tolerance and openness are also part of the Christian heritage. However, this should not prevent us from taking a close and critical look at Islam out of misconceived political correctness. Well over 400,000 members of the Muslim faith live in Switzerland. Certainly, only a small minority sympathizes with Islamist ideas. However, Muslim immigrants often come from countries where there is no democratic legal system. As a result, they sometimes bring with them ideas about law and order or the position of women that are incompatible with our legal system and our democratic rules of the game. Radicalization and isolationist tendencies are a problem that should not be underestimated. At the same time, Islamic communities are demanding to be recognized as public corporations or to have their clergy trained at our universities. These challenges must not be met naively. From the SVP's point of view, official recognition of Islam is not a viable path, as it will inevitably lead to far-reaching demands on the part of the Islamic community. Upholding freedom of belief and conscience Our spiritual, historical and cultural roots must be preserved and nurtured. It is the task of the churches to offer people support and real help in life through preaching and pastoral care. The churches thus make an essential contribution to a Switzerland based on solidarity. Neither a party nor the state should commit people to religious beliefs or prescribe a particular faith for them. Our freedom of faith and conscience allows all residents to think, write, speak - and confess freely. Churches and religious communities therefore enjoy freedom of preaching and freedom for church activities within the framework of the constitution. However, this tolerance finds its limits where religious communities, for their part, despise or even fight tolerance. Furthermore, it goes without saying that in the context of official state celebrations, Christian rites and symbols may be included as a reference to our Christian heritage. Demand compliance with our rules Just as we as guests in other countries adapt to the rules there, we in Switzerland must consistently insist on compliance with our law and customs. Parallel societies with their own legal system must not be tolerated. Our liberal legal system must not bow to Sharia under any circumstances. Under no circumstances may our courts use an Islamic cultural background to mitigate a sentence. Tolerating or even promoting practices such as forced marriage, honor killings, blood feuds, female circumcision, underage marriage or polygamy is absolutely unacceptable in this country. Our constitutional state has a duty to demand full respect for our legal system from immigrants and to avoid granting any concession, no matter how seemingly minor. No toleration of parallel societies The legal system must take appropriate measures to ensure that the problem with Islamism, for example, does not worsen. It must be made clear that our rules apply to all members of religious communities and that everyone who wants to live here must adapt. Equality before the law always applies. This is why, for example, dispensation from swimming lessons, the right to special grave rules in public cemeteries or the renunciation of the singing of Christmas carols in kindergarten are not permissible. The creeping spread of Sharia practices parallel to our constitutional state must also be vehemently prevented. Anyone who does not unconditionally support our free and democratic basic rights must not be naturalized. Anyone who actively opposes our value system and is not a Swiss citizen should be expelled. Viewpoints The SVP ... stands by the Christian-Western foundation of our state, our legal system and our culture; calls for crosses to be respected and tolerated as symbols of our Western Christian culture and our religion in public spaces; rejects religiously motivated special rights that contradict our legal system; requires all pupils at public schools to appear without headgear; supports the initiative for a ban on face coverings; rejects any claim to special burial rules in public cemeteries; opposes special holiday regulations for non-recognized religious communities; wants all pupils to attend the compulsory school subjects; demands the unconditional enforcement of the ban on minarets passed by the people; wants Swiss citizens who have been active abroad as terrorists or jihadists to be severely punished on their return to Switzerland; demands that foreigners or Swiss dual nationals who are active as terrorists or jihadists lose their residence status or Swiss citizenship with immediate effect and be deported; rejects the recognition of non-Western religious communities as public corporations and the state training of clergy from these religious communities. Advantages As a believer, this gives me the freedom to practice my religion; As parents, I have the certainty that my children can also be guided by Western Christian values at school; As a teacher, I want to be clear about my students' attendance at lessons; as citizens protection from violence and public incitement to hatred. Man, family, community Personal responsibility instead of paternalism The SVP supports the pursuit of happiness and contentment by everyone. Individual decisions must be made on their own responsibility; it must not be the case that the state ultimately decides on the success or failure of private life plans. The family must continue to play its role as a supporting pillar of society in the future. To achieve this, it needs a great deal of freedom and as little state intervention as possible. No nationalization of the family The state is increasingly intervening in the family structure by favoring certain family forms. For example, state subsidies and tax breaks for crèche care discriminate against the traditional family. The state also intervenes in areas where society functions smoothly, for example by paying for crèches for parents who do not need them financially. More and more forms of life are to be given the same legal status as marriage. The suspicion is that these measures are intended to help change society. The state is thus interfering more and more in the education of children instead of limiting itself to its educational mandate. School is being abused Due to supposed grievances, schools are often called upon to solve problems, whether in the area of sex education, dealing with media and consumption or ""political education"". A liberal understanding assumes that parents are responsible for the education of their children and that teachers can incorporate these topics and areas into the lessons on their own responsibility. Egalitarianism The planned reforms of marriage and family law lead to arbitrariness and non-bindingness. Marriage between a man and a woman is to be weakened by putting all possible forms of cohabitation on an equal footing with this union. For example, the equality of polygamy (polygamous marriages) is being discussed. Same-sex partnerships that are already recognized and legally equivalent to marriage should be considered marriage. Furthermore, mechanisms are to be put in place whereby adults living together with children will automatically be considered a family after a certain period of time. This opens the door to abuse and arbitrariness. Problems with inheritance law, social insurance, divorce law, alimony or tax law are inevitable. Such reforms do not lead to a liberal society, but to the nationalization of private life. They threaten important social cells such as the family, associations, foundations, churches, neighborhoods, and village and neighborhood communities that exist independently of the state. Free expression of opinion without a muzzle As feared, the racism penal norm, narrowly accepted by the people in 1994, has not proved its worth and must be abolished. The ever-expanding court practice shows the absurdity of this criminal provision. Resorting to criminal law to condemn opinions or intimidate those who hold them is profoundly undemocratic. A democracy has never failed because of too much freedom of expression - but it has failed because of too little. Strengthening families The family, and with it marriage between a man and a woman, form the basis of our society. Parents and children deserve special protection from the state. Parent couples or single parents are responsible for the upbringing and development of their children and provide them with love and security. The child learns help and consideration as well as the ability to resolve conflicts. More appreciation for voluntary work Valuable work is not only performed in the paid workplace, but also in the private sphere on a daily basis, whether in the form of helping neighbors, caring for relatives or looking after children. This work is increasingly being devalued and marginalized with the buzzword professionalization. State institutions such as crèches or lunch tables cannot replace parental love and care. The upbringing of children is the responsibility of the parents from birth until they reach the age of majority and cannot be delegated to the state. In addition to good professional development, training and continuing education opportunities, it is also important for our young people to have an environment that shows them appreciation and in which they can develop their personalities. The SVP therefore also supports clubs and youth associations as important providers of meaningful life and leisure activities and appreciates voluntary work. No battle between the sexes Men and women should complement each other. It is not gender but aptitude alone that should determine who holds which functions or offices. Equal rights and equal pay for work and performance of equal value for men and women are a matter of course for the SVP. Neither state equality offices nor other bureaucratic regulations such as wage police or quotas serve this goal. The SVP opposes egalitarianism and is committed to men and women taking responsibility for their own involvement as partners in family, society, work and politics. Viewpoints The SVP ... advocates personal responsibility and self-determination for families and opposes the increasing nationalization of families and children; demands that the smallest and most important cell of our society, the family, can live in freedom and without state paternalism; does not want multiple marriages, no absolute equality of same-sex partnerships with marriage, and no adoption of children by same-sex couples or so-called single-parent families; does not want forced marriages or the circumcision of girls, and the penal code must be applied consistently; rejects state-dictated paternity or parental leave; recognizes women and men as equal partners in work and society; rejects state quota rules and the proliferation of new regulations and provisions under the heading of gender policy; calls for the abolition of equality offices and other agencies that regulate private life and seek to re-educate society; does not want centrally prescribed day structures, but rather sensible offers at the municipal level, where there is a need and financing is primarily private; supports living together in families, clubs, neighborhoods, churches, village and district communities; calls for freedom of expression to be strengthened by repealing the criminal law on racism. Advantages That gives me: as an individual, as much freedom as possible and as little state paternalism as possible; as a family, freedom for independent development and protection from state influence on upbringing; love and security in the family as a child; as a single person, that I don't always have to pay more for others; Equal rights in the relationship between men and women. Stand up for Switzerland together with the SVP! Support the SVP with a donation to PC 30-8828-5 or IBAN CH80 0900 0000 3000 8828 5. Thank you very much."
43811,201110,"Switzerland offers its inhabitants a high quality of life, freedom, mobility, design and development opportunities. The country offers fertile ground for innovation, fresh ideas and exceptional performance. People can achieve their goals, and each individual contributes to the success of this successful model. THE FUTURE LIES IN THE FAMILY Even in a modern society, the family forms the basis. The future lies in our children and therefore in our families. Unlike other parties, the BDP explicitly promotes different family models and does not play them off against each other. The choice of the family model is a free decision of the persons concerned. The BDP identifies strongly with the ""traditional"" family, but at the same time supports modern forms of community with working parents. Jointly supported by business and the state, supplementary family services set important framework conditions and increase the attractiveness of a location and its competitiveness. Families who look after their children themselves should not be worse off. It is essential for the development of our society that all parents fulfill their educational duties and are supported by the community in doing so. PROSPECTS FOR ALL Secured access to good, solid basic and further education is of immense importance, especially in resource-poor Switzerland. Performance orientation ensures the innovative strength and competitiveness necessary for our country. Our well-balanced education system, consisting of vocational training and the academic path, is one of Switzerland's great achievements. The BDP wants perspectives for all. It is right and socio-politically sensible to promote and support those with learning difficulties. However, the BDP also consciously wants to give more support to those who are willing and/or talented to perform above average. They need new development opportunities. The elite - as the driving force for a competitive Switzerland - is not a dirty word for the BDP, we are committed to it and want to open up prospects for the willing young people to reach the top. Instead of short-term jubilation, the party promotes the joy and will of achievement and sustainable success. The BDP is happy for all who are successful! SAFETY IN EVERYDAY LIFE Switzerland with all its advantages is a popular and sought-after place to live and reside. This attracts not only highly qualified and motivated immigrants, but also free riders with criminal energy. For the BDP, one thing is clear: citizens must be able to move freely in our country and also feel safe in their everyday lives. Our country knows rules of coexistence and upholds its values and traditions. Those who break rules are punished. More determination is needed in the judiciary. Sanctions must be punitive in nature; perceived by the offender - and by the public - as punishment. Abuses in the asylum system must be combated consistently. All forms of unconstitutional political extremism must be stopped. FINANCES ECONOMY Switzerland's great strength is its stability. It succeeds in finding a central place in a globalized world and upholding its values, such as seriousness, competence and trustworthiness. However, economic competitiveness is not something that can be taken for granted; it has to be worked for and defended day after day. BUDGET MODERATELY The BDP's fiscal policy recipe is simple, but has proven itself time and again: You must not spend more than you earn. This means reviewing and prioritizing spending. They should primarily be made in areas where the state's key tasks and investments in the future are at stake: education, security and modern infrastructure facilities are the BDP's priorities. With a moderate spending policy, the BDP wants to create scope for tax cuts. These must benefit middle-income families first. There is no question of further increasing the tax burden in order to take on new tasks and make expenditures that do not move the country forward. After all, too high taxes reduce the willingness to pay. Tax honesty is important to the BDP. Switzerland does not have to accept the accusation of promoting tax fraud and serious tax evasion. The distinction between tax fraud and tax evasion must be abandoned in favor of a differentiation according to the severity of the offense and between intentional and negligent offenses. COMPETITIVE BUSINESS LOCATION The BDP wants to create optimal framework conditions and promote Switzerland as a competitive business location. These include, first and foremost, attractive tax conditions, good transport links by rail, road and air, and simple administrative procedures. Switzerland's autonomy and independence strengthen its position as a business location. The BDP is therefore also opposed to EU accession for economic reasons. However, we want to maintain good relations with our most important economic partner, the EU, as well as with other global powers, through bilateral agreements or other forms of cooperation. The BDP strives for a broad-based economy with a manufacturing industry, a healthy financial center and an attractive range of services. This also includes an independent, entrepreneurial agriculture, which supplies the population with first-class products and at the same time ensures the preservation and care of the habitats. These services are to be compensated in an appropriate manner. The BDP is committed to a strong research center in Switzerland. The country should be and remain a leader in crucial areas. RESPONSIBLE ENTREPRENEURSHIP If Switzerland wants to continue to be perceived as a serious, competent and trustworthy country, it needs a return to entrepreneurial virtues, such as honesty, decisiveness and ethical behavior. An ecologically and socially sustainable economy with responsibly managed companies is needed. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the central pillar of the local economy. They offer excellent examples of the innovative strength and dynamism in our country and are to be promoted. ENVIRONMENT ENERGY The Swiss landscape is unique in its beauty and complexity. It deserves consideration and sustainable use. Fundamentalism is a bad advisor in the fight for an intact environment. Closely linked to the environment is the issue of energy. The cornerstones of Swiss energy supply are security of supply, supply autonomy and supply management. ECOLOGICAL COMMITMENT AS AN OPPORTUNITY Ecological responsibility is not only a duty towards future generations, but also offers great economic opportunities with above-average innovation potential. BDP wants to take advantage of these opportunities and is focusing on innovations for more efficient and novel energy use. In addition, the economy needs sensible incentives to ensure that consumers are provided with an ecologically sensible range of products. SECURING THE ENERGY FUTURE Energy is the engine of our society. This makes it all the more important to use energy efficiently and to utilize renewable resources. Another reason to consistently promote the development of corresponding technologies. Not least with a view to an independent energy supply, dependence on fossil fuels and thus dependence on other countries must be reduced. The demand for electricity is increasing. The continued use of efficient and safe nuclear power plants will therefore also be necessary in Switzerland. However, the BDP supports the phase-out of nuclear power as soon as ecologically and economically viable alternatives are available that can reliably meet the growing demand for electricity. CARE FOR SWITZERLAND Respectful use of our resources also includes responsible spatial planning and settlement policies. In Switzerland, space is not unlimited. In order to maintain the attractiveness and diversity of our country, the urban sprawl of our landscape must be stopped. The Confederation, the cantons and the municipalities are obliged to treat the landscape and the soil in an economical and consistent manner."
43811,201510,"Successes of the BDP 2011- 2015 Orderly nuclear phase-out: In the spring of 2011, the BDP was the first conservative party to call for this, and it stands behind the energy turnaround and the energy tax without any ifs or buts. In the debate on the Energy Strategy 2050 in the National Council in the winter session of 2014, the BDP was able to push through its motion on the bonus/malus system and, together with the constructive center, was able to knock down decisive pegs in the entire debate. Automatic exchange of information / Clean financial center: The BDP was the first conservative party to call for the automatic exchange of information in accordance with the OECD standard as early as 2012 and has advocated a white money strategy from the outset. Bilateral route / accompanying measures / shortage of skilled workers: Long before February 9, 2014, the BDP repeatedly pointed out and demanded that the flanking measures be tightened and that the shortage of skilled workers be addressed quickly and efficiently. Following the adoption of the mass immigration initiative, the BDP was the first party to submit concrete proposals for solutions to the Federal Council, which were adopted by the business associations and other parties at the beginning of this year. The BDP was also the first party that wants to anchor the relationship with Europe in the constitution. Retirement Plan 2020: In 2011, the BDP was the first party to call for a debt brake for AHV and IV. In addition, the BDP has proposed a package of solutions for secure retirement provision for future generations as well, including, for example, indexing the retirement age to life expectancy. In addition, the BDP presented its generation project at the beginning of September. Woman power: The BDP consistently advocates for better frameworks for working mothers. Thanks to the BDP, supplementary family childcare will continue to be financed. Abolition of the marriage penalty: The BDP was the first party to call for this via a parliamentary group motion in the fall of 2011. Federal votes: Together with the glp, the BDP won the most national referendums in 2014 and has become an ""issue trendsetter"". 1 Switzerland and Europe The relationship with Europe is very important for our country. The BDP rejects Switzerland's accession to the EU, but does not want to allow our country to be sealed off either. The BDP clearly and unequivocally supports the bilateral path and stands by the free movement of persons. Switzerland is located in the middle of Europe and is part of the European family of nations and states. Many important cultural commonalities shape us as Europeans: democracy, human rights, the rule of law, the social market economy, fundamental Christian values. Economically, our country is very strongly linked to this Europe. Europe's fate is of the utmost importance to our own. Regardless of whether the EU as a project of Europe is judged to be good or bad, it is clear that Switzerland must and will maintain solid, pragmatic and friendly relations with the EU in its own interest. In the long run, we could not afford massive permanent conflicts with the EU. Europe can live without Switzerland if necessary, but Switzerland can hardly live without Europe. Our exports and imports to and from the EU are of paramount importance. However, this realization must not lead us to fail to defend our interests with vigor and self-confidence. Our European policy must support efforts to ensure the continent's economic and social stability. This is clearly in the interest of our country and its self-determination. Peace and stability in Europe are the prerequisite and foundation for our own liberal development. In the view of the BDP, EU accession is not an objective of Swiss foreign policy. At present and in the future, relations with the EU can be sufficiently shaped without accession. This position must always be reviewed. The decisive factor here is not an ideologically stubborn nationalist stance, but the welfare and interests of our people and our country. We see Switzerland's cooperation with the EU and the protection of our interests primarily within the framework of bilateral treaties for all problems that arise. In doing so, the BDP will also accept an institutional framework. Note: See also Foreign Policy (item 8). 2 Energy/Environment The BDP stands behind an energy transition based on competition and civic criteria without any ifs or buts. This clear stance of the BDP clearly distinguishes energy policy from other bourgeois parties. Hardly justifiable costs, lack of acceptance and responsibility towards future generations require a gradual phase-out of nuclear energy. Security of energy supply will continue to be of central importance in the future. The BDP pays full attention to the environment. In the implementation of both energy and environmental policy goals, the polluter-pays principle and incentive systems clearly take precedence over direct government intervention. Incentive taxes must play an important role here as a market-based instrument. By phasing out nuclear energy in an orderly manner (using existing nuclear power plants, but not building any new ones), the BDP wants to secure supplies for the period of the energy transition and protect the investments made. At the same time, the phase-out offers great economic opportunities (innovation potential). Energy efficiency must be promoted for all energy sources. For the key energy of electricity, the BDP relies primarily on hydropower. Approval procedures must be expedited. For the implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050, the BDP relies above all on the system of incentive levies, which are to be budget neutral and fiscal quota neutral. In many cases, alternative energy projects can be operated successfully and economically. Mitigating measures must be provided for energy-intensive companies and peripheral regions. For Switzerland, a well-functioning energy supply is of crucial importance. Energy and especially electricity have become an integral part of our lives. Both accompany us at work, in our own homes and in our leisure time. An adequate, economical, versatile and environmentally friendly energy supply is therefore a prerequisite for the prosperous development of the national economy. We also support the Federal Council's energy strategy because it is time to reduce our country's dependence on imported oil. The economic benefit of energy production in the field of renewable energy is to be highly weighted. Innovative projects for the use of alternative energy sources (solar, wind, water, etc.) should be given the necessary leeway for realization with appropriate relaxation of building and protection legislation. The promotion of renewable energies is one way that allows us to keep most of the value chain in our regions. Natural domestic energy raw materials guarantee a large availability in the own country and an additional branch of income in Switzerland. Renewable energies offer some potential for securing the energy supply in the long term if they are properly promoted. Priority must be given to domestic power generation. Basing the energy supply on imports is not desirable, because in this solution the investments and the added value would be exported and supply problems could be expected in the event of supply bottlenecks. The implementation of the energy transition is at the same time the best environmental policy, especially the reduction of CO2 emissions. We recognize the changes in environmental conditions caused by the warming of the world climate. We recognize the need for action to protect our environment as an investment in future generations. 3 Intergenerational contract Pension provision must be financially stabilized in such a way that future generations can also benefit from it. The social and material balance between the generations is of great importance for the cohesion of our society. Demographic development urgently requires viable reforms, especially to protect the interests of the next generations. We want to maintain the three-pillar system, which has proven itself in principle. By gradually creating incentives to work beyond the age limit, by eliminating disincentives to hire older workers, and by offering flexible wage, work, and part-time retirement models, we want to advocate for appropriate reforms. The BDP wants to retain the basic elements of the system and their strengths, namely the pay-as-you-go system and solidarity between income groups in AHV, the funded system in BVG and the mandatory system in health insurance. When it comes to financing the AHV and BVG, a further increase in the wage burden must be strictly rejected, as this would impair the international competitiveness of our economy. The number of pensioners is increasing in relation to the working population. The associated need for funds must not be shifted unilaterally onto the working population. With an automatic link between retirement age and life expectancy, economic realities can be taken into account. The BDP wants to do everything in its power to ensure that the intergenerational contract, on the one hand, and the distribution of the burden among the state, the economy, the working population and senior citizens, on the other, are as fair as possible. Government spending in the social sector must not continue to rise as a share of GDP. Private pension provision, on the other hand, must be promoted decisively more and sustainably. 4 Liberal society Even in modern society, security plays an important role in the life of every individual. The family is such an important home. The BDP explicitly does not play the different forms of private cohabitation off against each other, but accepts and supports them all equally. What is crucial is the fact that people feel comfortable in their smallest private domestic communities, show solidarity, give children a haven of security and teach them values as well as social behavior. Children and thus their domestic communities must have the best possible framework conditions. This is where the state cannot avoid making its targeted contributions. But the economy must also increasingly enable men and women with newer lifestyles to devote themselves to both family and professional tasks. In this sense, the BDP is committed to strengthening and improving the living situation of families and children, especially for optimal framework conditions such as block times, day schools and family-supplementary care. The best interests of the child must always be given high priority. The BDP wants a tax and pension system that is independent of marital status, as well as appropriate relief for those who provide for children. For the BDP, liberal also means socially liberal; it respects and protects individual and personally made decisions regarding ways of life. It is not up to the legislator to favor or discriminate against sexual orientations. With this stance, the BDP, as a bourgeois party, consciously differentiates itself from parties with value-conservative social policies. 5 Spatial planning The BDP wants to enable sustainable development while helping to preserve as much valuable cultivated land as possible. Spatial planning must ensure that more dense construction is consistently carried out, that better use is made of existing building fabric, and that the relaxation of forest legislation is realized. Sustainably producing agriculture should make a significant contribution to maintaining the cultural landscape. The BDP is committed to decentralized settlement in Switzerland and to the measures associated with it. A key strength of Swiss society is its cohesion across different geographic regions. This basic value must be preserved. A lively decentralized settlement is a guarantor of a diverse culture and contributes to the preservation of the many traditions of our society. We are committed to promoting rural regions by specifically promoting the strengths of the respective areas. In doing so, we pay attention to the efficient use of resources. By keeping important basic public infrastructures decentralized, we ensure dynamic regional centers. In these, there must be very good education and training opportunities. As part of the structural reforms in agriculture, numerous buildings will no longer be used for production in the future. The spatial planning legislation must be adapted so that a rapid, unbureaucratic conversion of this building fabric can be achieved. Through targeted measures, we promote understanding and cooperation between the rural regions and the centers, and vice versa. 6 Safety The BDP is committed to a credible security policy and stands by the mission of the armed forces. Foreign deployments according to previous principles should also be possible in the future. Internal security must be strengthened through clearly defined cooperation between all parties involved, such as cantonal police corps, border guards, intelligence services, civil defense, among others. Violence in public spaces and crime must be combated consistently. Our population and our businesses must also be protected from cyber attacks. The BDP is committed to a powerful army with clearly defined missions. The army defends Switzerland and its population. It supports the civilian authorities when their resources are no longer sufficient, and it contributes to international peacebuilding. Although a military attack seems unlikely today, it cannot be ruled out for the future. The army must therefore be in a position to repel a possible attack. This requires that it be granted the necessary financial resources to do so. The support missions of the armed forces in favor of the civilian authorities at home should only be subsidiary, limited in time and restricted to major events. Cooperation remains the right basic security strategy, both at home and abroad. Switzerland must actively participate in international cooperation in all areas of external and internal security. However, this is only as far as our neutrality allows. Special security-related efforts with additional resources are an absolute priority in the area of digital networking (cyber, IT). Joining a defense alliance is out of the question. The militia system must be maintained. This ensures that the armed forces remain anchored in the population and that they can benefit from the knowledge and skills of citizens. The citizens of Switzerland must be able to move about in our public sphere day and night without fear. Public safety is a cornerstone of the state's mission. It must be fulfilled by the community. Activities and behavior that endanger public safety shall be discouraged. Unauthorized demonstrations will not be tolerated and will be prevented by political leaders and the police. Violence and damage to property in public spaces are rigorously punished. Hooded people will be reported. Bans on begging should be considered. Whoever defaces the public space with dirt, garbage or spray-paintings must take responsibility for it. We are well aware that these demands require more police. We accept this responsibility and are prepared to share the financial consequences. We are also committed to tougher and more consistent criminal law, the current application of which is increasingly being met with incomprehension. In the area of sexual offenses in particular - especially against minors - there is a need for action to tighten up the law. 7 Education The BDP is committed to an above-average education system that provides equal opportunities for all. The compulsory learning of another national language in elementary school promotes national cohesion. The dual vocational education and training system and higher vocational education and training must be further strengthened; these should above all promote the next generation of domestic skilled workers and be geared to the needs of the economy. The promotion of young domestic scientists must become stronger in the coming years. Education is Switzerland's raw material. This means that we must make very special efforts in the areas of education, training, development and research. In doing so, it is important to measure ourselves against the rising performance of other nations around the world. Global competition will be decided in the fields of education and innovation. We can be proud of the quite good education system in Switzerland, but we should remain critical. We have to ensure that everyone enjoys a good solid education, including the weak. But we also need elites, above-average talents and achievement-oriented people. These must be particularly promoted; they are of great importance in the future for the prosperity of the entire nation. Achievement orientation in education is right. Switzerland-wide harmonization of teaching objectives in elementary school is right; Curriculum 21 provides a common basis for this. With the social development and more and more division of labor economy, it is necessary that parents are supported by the community in the performance of their indispensable private responsibility for upbringing and promotion. Day structures such as lunch and after-hours care enable parents to reconcile work and family life. We attach great importance to the training and further education of pedagogical specialists. They deserve recognition and must be supported with good working conditions in their daily work. The ""dual system"" of vocational education and training must continue to receive special support and further development in our country in the future. In this context, special attention must be paid to the training of middle managers (higher vocational training). Individual universities and universities of applied sciences are to receive more support than before from the state and industry for their struggle in international competition. The state and the private sector working together are successful. The BDP is critical of the privatization of elementary schools. The state school must be strengthened through internal competition. The social mix in elementary schools is of socio-political and therefore also state-political importance. Within a defined framework, private schools should be able to develop at the elementary school level. The BDP deliberately wants to promote private sponsorships at the upper secondary and tertiary levels. 8 Foreign policy For the BDP, foreign policy means representing the interests of our country and explicitly not pursuing ideological left-wing or right-wing nationalist goals. The BDP supports an active role for Switzerland in the UN, the OECD, the OSCE and other international organizations. Switzerland should remain neutral. Many international agreements serve our security, especially international legal security (bilateral agreements, trade law, international law, etc.). This is of great interest and benefit to a landlocked country like Switzerland, which is poor in raw materials, has a small population, but is highly economically interconnected worldwide. In this sense, foreign policy activities, even if not always immediately recognized as ""useful,"" are extraordinarily important for Switzerland. Foreign policy with high-quality diplomacy serves to represent Switzerland's interests and also offers the opportunity to demonstrate our solidarity with the world; a solidarity on which we ourselves are particularly dependent. Our country must provide substantial development aid. The importance of foreign policy will increase for our country due to increased globalization in a wide range of areas. In many areas, foreign policy is already domestic policy and will become even more so. The BDP therefore wants to pay special attention to foreign policy in the interest of our population. Due to the constant development of science and technology, national borders have become more permeable, whether intentionally or not. Information flows (Internet... !), digitalization, mobility, huge transport capacities as well as enormous capital shifts are forcing traditional nation states to cooperate more. In its own interest, Switzerland is well advised to engage with many globally active organizations and institutions. Of course, many international organizations are not that efficient and often get bogged down in debating. Nevertheless, the achievements of, for example, the UN and several of its sub-organizations should not be underestimated (identification of developments, exchange of information and opinions). Helping to shape things is always better than just following what others have determined. By actively participating, we can always promote and advocate for our country's specific concerns in addition to making meaningful contributions to finding solutions to international problems. Foreign policy is always also the representation of one's own interests. In addition to the humanitarian idea for all mankind, it is also good for ourselves if we succeed in preventing wars or at least making them very difficult by creating mutual dependencies. Schengen/Dublin serves the security of our country. Isolation in the exchange of information and cooperation in the field of European policing would be of great disadvantage to our country in the long run. Switzerland should maintain its traditional military neutrality in accordance with international recognition and also use it to pursue an active foreign policy. 9 Women and youth Women are to be given equal consideration when filling management positions and public offices. This is a demand also on ourselves. The interests and concerns of young people are important and must be better taken into account (e.g. conversion rate for the pension fund). The future belongs to the young. Therefore, they must be included in the decision-making processes. The BDP wants to promote women in a conscious and targeted manner. This is a concrete obligation for all bodies and representatives of the party. Wherever there are opportunities to bring qualified women into management positions or to elect them to public office, the BDP and its representatives should become active. We clearly reject rigid quotas. It goes without saying that a woman is not preferred to a man just because she is a woman; the qualifications must be right for both sexes. However, we believe that there are still too few women in management positions. Women bring different values and characteristics with their life biography. A good mix of the sexes at as many levels as possible must become quite normal over time. Everyone will benefit. Some women, despite being well qualified, are sometimes unwilling to make career moves, for a variety of reasons. We do not want to push and ""force"", but encourage. This also includes the BDP's consistent commitment to equal pay. This cannot be achieved through more government regulations, but through persuasion and concrete action. The BDP also wants to implement this policy in itself and be measured against it. Young citizens form the future backbone of our society. The political understanding we give them today will be expressed in future policies. We want to model a policy of responsibility and mutual respect for our young members. A policy based on personal responsibility and acceptance of those who think differently. An ideology that wants to transfer as many social responsibilities as possible to the state is just as hostile to the future as a system of exclusion and intolerance. The young stratum of the population has to bear ever greater social burdens. To ensure that the intergenerational contract does not falter, the young must be made aware of their responsibilities. On the other hand, society must not place the social burden on the young in an increasingly concentrated way. Instead, financing systems must be found that provide more relief for young people, especially young families - including social security contributions. 10 Finance The public sector has to be economical with its financial resources and should strictly adhere to strict regulations. Both the government ratio and the fiscal ratio may no longer increase. The BDP consistently opposes new taxes and levies. The country's population is doing well when its economy is doing well. The economy needs a stable fiscal policy framework with good and efficient government services and the lowest possible taxes. The state must therefore be as efficient as it is lean. However, demographic developments will place an increasing burden on social security systems and public budgets. At the same time, national and international competition between locations requires the state to create room for maneuver in order to respond to new developments. In particular, funds are needed to set targeted future-oriented political priorities, especially in the areas of education, Research, Traffic, Environment and security. Only financially sound public budgets are capable of meeting these manifold challenges without burdening future generations with the accumulation of debt. The debt level of the federal government and the cantons must therefore continue to be reduced with determination. A policy that follows the principle of consistent debt reduction strengthens the confidence and willingness of citizens and companies to invest in their own business location. Today's debts are tomorrow's taxes. Our country's prosperity is at risk if it continues to spend more than it takes in. In terms of intergenerational justice, excessive public debt is antisocial. 11 Health Health policy ensures primary care and care for all and promotes cutting-edge medicine. In this context, framework conditions must be created that enable competition between public and private service providers. Basic outpatient and inpatient medical care and nursing must be ensured for all groups of insured persons. We demand framework conditions that promote indispensable, high-quality family medicine. Family physicians play a central role in primary care; therefore, their position must be strengthened. The introduction of appropriate quality and cost criteria facilitates objectively justifiable structural decisions in the area of public and private hospitals and provides citizens with greater transparency. We support the further development of cutting-edge medicine, taking into account clear ethical guidelines. Networking of university hospitals in Switzerland and neighboring countries, as well as a sensible concentration of highly specialized services at fewer sites than today, is important to us for reasons of quality and cost. Care in hospitals, homes, and especially by Spitex at home will require more human resources in the future. Palliative medicine and care must be made possible at as many locations as possible. Special attention must therefore be paid to training in the nursing professions. 12 Democracy and the rule of law For the BDP, democracy and the rule of law belong together. Developments in many countries show us that democracy is damaged if there is no functioning rule of law with a corresponding separation of powers. Our constitutional state is the guarantor of the correct implementation of the will of the people and the protection of citizens' rights. We are committed to a well-functioning rule of law and to strengthening the pillars on which it is based. In a liberal democracy, it is the task of the constitutional state to guarantee security for all. Law-free spaces must not be tolerated. In addition to the dangers it poses, the insecurity it creates destabilizes our democracy; citizens who fall victim to attacks in such spaces lose confidence in our authorities. The BDP is therefore firmly committed to guaranteeing security and freedom. We want an efficient administration, in the service of citizens. In a democracy, the rule of law guarantees its citizens a high degree of participation. The state is obliged to ensure that the will of the people is respected. The BDP therefore demands a high level of respect for popular decisions from politicians and administrators, combined with a commitment to strict objectivity. The division of powers into the judiciary, the legislature and the executive guarantees the proper functioning of our democracy. All parties are required to strictly respect the separation of powers. Court decisions are to be respected. Human rights are fundamental rights for all people. National borders have no meaning there. Switzerland should clearly commit to the ECHR and actively stand up for it. (Note: See also item no. 6 Safety). 13 Immigration policy Policy on foreigners must have clear and enforceable rules. The immigration of qualified workers is economically necessary. The EU is the most important partner in this regard. The free movement of persons is in the interest of Switzerland. Integration must be actively pursued and demanded. The management of immigration must be primarily geared to the needs of the labor market. Qualified workers are to be recruited primarily from the EU/EFTA area, from outside only if there are none in the said European area. As a matter of principle, low-skilled workers should not be recruited from outside the EU/EFTA area. Exceptions to this must be regulated by law. In the case of asylum policy, abuse must be severely punished in any case. In doing so, we must not shy away from unpopular measures. The actual right to asylum should be strengthened by consistently combating abuses. It goes without saying that Switzerland should offer protection to people from other countries whose lives are threatened. Switzerland must make every effort to cooperate very closely with neighboring countries and European institutions in the area of asylum policy. Migration flows are a worldwide and especially a European problem, which will increase in explosiveness. Therefore, Switzerland's active participation in the development of international standards is necessary and important. Integration measures are to be enforced by the state. Foreigners must be required to make an active effort to integrate. Anyone who deliberately does not want to integrate or respect our constitution has no right to be a guest here. The BDP wants to contribute to a clear distinction between the free movement of persons (Switzerland/EU) and the problems of the right of asylum, in particular the safeguarding of asylum. 14 Economy The basis for growth and prosperity is acting on one's own responsibility and willingness to perform. The export industry and the financial center must be strengthened by expanding and safeguarding internationally secured rules and agreements. SMEs must be protected from further administrative and tax burdens. Freedom and a market economy are indispensable foundations for successful economic and social development. Freedom and responsibility belong together. The state ensures clear, manageable and fair rules and framework conditions as well as social balance. In return, companies and citizens should have as much entrepreneurial freedom as possible. The BDP is particularly interested in people who think and act like medium-sized businesses. Medium-sized companies think and act on the basis of sustainable, intergenerational and solid financial behavior, a willingness to perform and a sense of responsibility towards the community. We pay particular attention to these small and medium-sized enterprises. It must be actively protected from more and more burdens and possibly relieved. The urban economic centers are the engines of economic development. The aim is to create the conditions that will enable them to hold their own in international competition. This is also in the interest of the structurally weaker hinterland. Dynamic centers act as drawing cards for the settlement of new enterprises and thus promote the creation and preservation of jobs. This is particularly successful when the headquarters and decision-making centers of large corporations, research companies, high-tech enterprises, and technical colleges and universities are located in the economic centers. Very good transport links to the core economic regions are a must. A wide range of leisure and cultural activities contributes to the attractiveness of the centers. Security for cultural and meeting areas is very important. Child and family friendliness must be specifically promoted by offering high-quality education at schools, reliable and flexible childcare structures, a safe living environment and affordable housing. The BDP supports agriculture, which makes an important contribution to food security. Their ecological services and services for the common good must continue to be remunerated in accordance with the costs incurred. Structural change must take place at a socially and operationally acceptable pace. Tourism is important for economic stability in peripheral regions. The tourism regions should continue to receive state support for infrastructural tasks. 15 Mobility Mobility is central to economic and cultural development. Private and public transport complement each other. Our country's transportation network, both rail and road, is one of the lifelines of our economy and society. Our residents travel several distances every day, spending an average of over an hour on the road. They use footpaths, bicycle paths, but above all roads and railways for public or private transport. The transport systems in the agglomerations are reaching their limits in Switzerland today. In this situation, it is important to expand and secure mobility throughout the country. Cities and agglomerations as nationally and internationally known congestion hotspots lead to economic difficulties and limit the quality of life of the affected population. Only an efficient transport infrastructure can secure economic growth and jobs. Sufficient and constant funds must therefore be made available for the expansion of the transport infrastructure - on rail and road. In this context, individual and public transport are to be promoted equally. Weakening one would lead to a weakening of the overall system and thus to the weakening of the other. A level playing field for all transport users and economic entities ensures a sensible coexistence of public and private transport. Ideological barriers must not be allowed to impede securing the mobility necessary for economic development. The systematic expansion of the transport infrastructure (FABI and NAF) are entirely in line with the BDP. Mobility for people with disabilities is a matter of course."
43811,201910,"Pension provision in Switzerland - also for future generations The BDP is committed to the sustainable stabilization and safeguarding of social welfare systems so that future generations can also benefit from them. The three-pillar system has basically proved its worth. The BDP wants to maintain the strengths of the system. However, adjustments are needed to secure the social security system in the long term. The history of pension provision in Switzerland shows that it has often been defined along political lines, paying too little attention to economic facts. As a result, financial bottlenecks have emerged that threaten sustainability for future generations. The three pillars highlighted in brief: The AHV is based on the pay-as-you-go system and serves to secure subsistence. To a certain extent, it can be described as one of the largest solidarity works in Swiss history. Occupational pension provision is caught between conversion rates, returns and life expectancy. Private pension provision can and must be decisively promoted. Challenges 1st pillar: AHV In addition to its function of providing for people's livelihoods, the AHV has a strong redistributive element. Since higher incomes pay more contributions than would be needed to fund their pensions, and low incomes receive more benefits than their contributions generate, money flows from high to low incomes. The AHV is therefore one of the largest and most impressive works of solidarity in Switzerland. When the AHV was enshrined in law in 1948, the average life expectancy was 66.4 years for men and 70.9 years for women. At that time, the retirement age was set at 65 for both sexes. By 2017, life expectancy had increased to 81.4 years for men and 85.4 years for women. The retirement age for women was lowered from 65 to 62 in two revisions and then raised again to 64 in 2005. By basing it on an absolute retirement age, demographic developments play a central role. An automatic link between retirement age and life expectancy is an ideal way to address this fact and depoliticize the retirement age issue. Pillar 2: Occupational pension plan The 2nd pillar is based on the funded method and includes pension fund benefits. Its purpose is to maintain the accustomed standard of living in a reasonable manner. The savings obligation for employed persons begins at the age of 25. Here, too, demography in the form of higher life expectancy plays a decisive role, and the politically determined conversion rates lag behind this development. At the same time, the aim is to achieve a minimum return, which is very difficult to achieve in the current market environment. And there are few signs that this market environment will improve markedly in the foreseeable future. Here, for example, access to new investment opportunities can improve return opportunities without disproportionately increasing risks. Pillar 3: Private pension provision With the so-called self-provision, the 1st and 2nd pillars can be supplemented individually. In addition to the tax incentives, the uncertainties surrounding the financing of the 1st and 2nd pillars have made the 3rd pillar even more attractive. However, paying into the 3rd pillar requires corresponding disposable income and is therefore not accessible to all income classes in practice. Additional support for private pension provision could therefore be linked to a certain solidarity component. Specific positions and demands of the BDP Overview Link between retirement age and life expectancy Fiscal rules for social insurance (debt brake) Compulsory pension fund for employed persons from the age of 18 Improved labor market opportunities for the older generation Strengthening of private pension provision with simultaneous solidarity component Linking retirement age and life expectancy Various discussions surrounding the retirement age have repeatedly shown that political and emotional aspects drown out economic facts. This has been impressively demonstrated, for example, by the discussion about retirement age 67. Rationally speaking - and also with a view to developments in other countries - it would have to be acknowledged that the retirement age would probably be in the region of 70 years around 2050. In order to better take into account the economic facts given by the demographic development, the question of the retirement age must be depoliticized. The BDP calls for the introduction of an automatic mechanism that will in future automatically adjust the retirement age in line with rising life expectancy. Despite differences in life expectancy, the retirement age for women and men is assumed to be the same. Likewise, occupation-specific and individual flexibilities should continue to be possible - within a certain bandwidth. However, the central aspect of automaticity is that, together with life expectancy, not only the statutory retirement age rises, but also the actual retirement age. So the bandwidth within which flexibilities are possible must also be part of the automatism. The BDP raised this demand for a link between retirement age and life expectancy in a motion and a parliamentary initiative as early as 2012 and 2013. With the retirement of the baby boomer cohorts and after (yet another) failed pension reform, the demand for a link between retirement age and life expectancy is still highly topical. It is the most effective measure for the sustainable restructuring of the social security system. Debt brake The BDP is calling for fiscal rules for the AHV (and IV) that limit the indebtedness of the two social security funds. The fiscal rules should include the following elements: A trigger must be provided that defines the financial threshold / the amount of the deficit / the fund assets as a percentage of expenditure or the debt as a percentage of contributions, above which political measures are mandatory. The political mandate, which measures the political actors have to take in which timeframes, in case the trigger is exceeded, has to be defined. Automatically triggered measures must be provided for if the political mandate is not implemented within certain deadlines, so that a further slide of the social security system into financial imbalance can be prevented. A moderate consideration of the economic situation and the inclusion of the expected future development are to be examined. The comparatively good state of public finances in our country in an international context is due not least to the debt brake. This instrument ensures that federal spending does not exceed revenues over a business cycle and prevents debt from spiraling out of control. In the revision approved by the Swiss electorate in 2010, such a rule was also introduced for unemployment insurance (ALV). However, the old-age and survivors' insurance (AHV) and the disability insurance (IV) are not subject to such control today. Rather, both the entitlements of beneficiaries and the contributions to these social welfare funds are fixed by law, without any guarantee that the revenues will actually cover the expenditures. In view of the financial imbalance in which the AHV finds itself, there is a great danger that a restructuring cannot be realized or can be realized much too late as a result of political blockades. This can be prevented in the future with a debt brake. The BDP already called for a debt brake for the social security funds in March 2011. The identical motions 11.3106 by the BDP parliamentary group and 11.3113 by BDP Council of States member Werner Luginbühl instructed the Federal Council to provide for mandatory fiscal rules in the 11th AHV revision and the 6th IV revision. Parliament approved Werner Luginbühl's motion. The introduction of fiscal rules was written off in connection with the 2020 pension bill, which failed before the people. However, the failure of the 2020 pension plan does not change the urgency of introducing a debt brake. The BDP will therefore submit corresponding proposals again in May 2019. Early savings in the pension fund As a further measure to secure old-age provision, the BDP considers it sensible if, instead of paying into the 2nd pillar from the age of 25 as is currently the case, contributions are now paid into the 2nd pillar from the age of 18 or after completion of initial education. Not only with the increase of the retirement age is a higher deposit period achieved, but also if you start saving earlier. The longer deposit period and the higher savings amount have a positive effect on compound interest in particular. People who do not yet receive a salary at the age of 18 (students) often later receive a higher salary corresponding to their education and thus save a higher retirement capital. The situation is different for employees who do not undergo special training. As a rule, their salary remains lower and the longer payment period pays off at the end in the saved capital. In the case of pension funds, these persons are already covered from the age of 18 and pay risk premiums. The administrative effort is therefore justifiable. Moreover, this would not be more than consistent with the AHV, where the obligation to pay in also starts at the age of 18. In September 2012, the BDP parliamentary group submitted a postulate on this (12.3811), which was accepted by parliament. The postulate was written off in connection with the ""Retirement Provision 2020"" bill. The ""Altersvorsorge 2020"" has been rejected by the sovereign, but earlier savings in the pension fund were never the subject of criticism and must therefore be pursued. The BDP will therefore submit a corresponding motion again in May 2019. Improved labor market opportunities for the older generation The increase in the retirement age demanded by the BDP only makes sense if the current disadvantage of older job seekers can be largely eliminated. Today, those who lose their jobs shortly before retirement age remain unemployed in most cases. Especially recently, this issue has been widely and emotionally discussed among the population. The reasons for this disadvantage may vary; but pension fund contributions, which increase with aging, are undoubtedly partly to blame. From the employer's point of view in particular, this makes older workers ""more expensive"". This can be a decisive criterion, especially for SMEs, for not considering older job seekers despite their experience and expertise, often for simple economic reasons. In December 2012, the BDP therefore called for a package of measures to improve labor market opportunities for the older generation. In particular, a standardization of the LOB rates should be examined. The National Council accepted the corresponding postulate; unfortunately, the Council of States rejected it. However, on May 4, 2017, the BDP submitted a motion calling specifically for the disadvantages of the older generation in the BVG to be abolished and for a uniform rate to be introduced for retirement credits. Strengthening private pension provision with a simultaneous solidarity component Under pillar 3a, individuals can invest a maximum amount (CHF 6,826 for 2019) in private pension provision each year and deduct this payment from their taxable income. This is an attractive and sensible supplement to the 1st and 2nd pillars, which strengthens individual pension provision, but is also suitable for home savings, for example. The 3rd pillar does not include a solidarity component. Expanding the options under pillar 3a could introduce a solidarity contribution on the one hand and additionally strengthen private pension provision on the other. For example, a so-called pillar 3a+ could be created, which would allow a further retirement savings account in addition to the existing pillar 3a, into which the maximum amount can also be paid and deducted from taxable income. However, before the amount paid in is credited to the account, (for example) 8.4% (today's AHV contribution) is deducted and (for example) added to the AHV. Building up a 3rd pillar as a private pension requires a rather higher disposable income. With an additional expansion, however, not only the higher incomes are to be favored, but at the same time a solidarity contribution is to be paid. In December 2012, the BDP therefore called for the expansion of the 3rd pillar with additional options for private provision and a simultaneous solidarity component, without finding a majority for this in the National Council. With these positions and demands, the BDP would like to make a contribution to the long-term and sustainable safeguarding of social security systems, while at the same time emphasizing economic considerations over political ones. The proposals outlined do not claim to provide a complete solution to all challenges. FACTSHEET: Asylum policy Migration has been taking place since humans have existed, and it has always followed prosperity. There were times when the inhabitants of Switzerland also took their fate into their own hands and sought their fortune abroad. Today, Switzerland's prosperity and high standard of living make it an attractive attraction for global migration. Caring for Switzerland's humanitarian tradition Quite a few people seek refuge in Switzerland because their lives are threatened at home or because they simply no longer see any prospects. These people want to participate in the prosperity in Switzerland, but they can also contribute to this prosperity. Switzerland has long been characterized by a proven humanitarian tradition that offers hospitality to others as long as they are threatened at home and as long as they abide by the rules of the game in Switzerland. The BDP stands behind this humanitarian tradition of Switzerland and wants to take care of it. A credible asylum policy In order for the asylum system in Switzerland to retain a high level of acceptance among its own population, it must be credible and also restrictive in several respects. In particular, abuses must be pursued and punished with the utmost consistency. Likewise, asylum procedures must be handled as quickly and unbureaucratically as possible. Asylum seekers whose applications are approved are just as entitled to a quick decision as asylum seekers whose applications are rejected. The BDP is behind the projects of the Federal Council and Parliament, in which namely the creation of so-called federal centers should lead to faster procedures. At the same time, the federal government must ease the burden on the border cantons in particular. The BDP believes that the status of ""provisional admission"" should be reviewed. In principle, it is correct that those seeking protection may remain in Switzerland ""temporarily"" even if their application for asylum is rejected, as long as their life and limb are threatened at home. However, it is undoubtedly not in the spirit of ""provisional admission"" that this state of affairs lasts for ten years or more. This fact must be taken into account in one of the next revisions of the Asylum Act. Integration as a social and economic factor. Those who are allowed to stay in Switzerland should integrate as quickly as possible. To this end, the BDP focuses on better and more efficient integration into the work process. It demanded this in the 2015 special session via a motion by BDP National Councilor Hans Grunder. http://www.parlament.ch/d/suche/seiten/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20153141 There is still a lot of untapped potential in the employment of asylum seekers. Integration into the labor market also improves social inclusion and can reduce abuses. At the same time, dependence on other foreign labor is reduced, resulting in lower immigration. This is also in the spirit of the electorate, which accepted the so-called mass immigration initiative on February 9, 2014. International cooperation Switzerland must comply with the rights and obligations of the Dublin Agreement, but must also demand this of other states. Migration as a global challenge can only be meaningfully mastered by countries cooperating internationally. In particular, the unspeakable abuses and disasters in the Mediterranean region, but also the fight against trafficking in human beings must be coordinated internationally. For example, the BDP would support the reintroduction of embassy asylum, provided this is also the case in other relevant countries. FACTSHEET: For the Bilateral Way and Against Segregation Why is the Bilateral Way the Right Way? The European Union (EU) is by far Switzerland's most important partner politically, economically and socially. Good relations with the EU are a prerequisite for Switzerland's future prosperity. Thanks to the bilateral sectoral agreements with the EU, Switzerland has a unique, tailor-made relationship in which the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages. The bilateral route not only gives Switzerland extensive access to the European market, but it is also the basis for close cooperation in important political areas. With its bilateral approach, Switzerland is pursuing a policy of openness instead of a backward-looking policy of isolation. Economy: The bilateral route gives the Swiss economy extensive access to the European single market and thus to over 500 million consumers. Thanks to market access and the increased competition that comes with it, the Swiss economy can grow and thus not only secure jobs, but also create new ones. A discontinuation of the bilateral agreements would lead to significantly weaker economic growth in Switzerland. In addition, Switzerland would have to reckon with a reduction in the attractiveness of its location. The following figures speak for themselves: Two-thirds of Swiss foreign trade is with the EU. 54% of all Swiss exports worth CHF 113 billion (as of 2016) go to the EU. CHF (as at 2016) go to the EU. 72% of all imports come from the EU. Around 78% of foreign capital in Switzerland comes from the EU, making the EU Switzerland's most important partner in terms of direct investment as well. Policy: It is not only the economy that benefits from the bilateral path; political issues that are important for Switzerland, such as internal security, asylum, the environment or culture, are also hardly conceivable without the agreements with the EU. As an example, the positive effects of Schengen/Dublin are briefly outlined here: Switzerland benefits massively from cross-border police cooperation as well as from clear responsibilities in the handling of asylum applications and for avoiding multiple procedures for the handling of the same asylum application. Thanks to Dublin, such requests can be identified and the applicants can be sent back to the responsible states. Without these agreements, Switzerland would have to handle all asylum applications itself again, without the possibility of sending them back to another state. Free movement of persons: The Swiss economy benefits most from the free movement of persons. It expands the Swiss labor market to the entire EU area. Swiss companies can thus grow and avoid personnel bottlenecks. Here, too, the figures speak for themselves: in 2016, more than 464,400 Swiss nationals worked in the EU. 1,390,405 EU citizens lived and worked in Switzerland in 2016, plus 320,000 cross-border commuters. In order to prevent abuses in wage and working conditions in Switzerland, the free movement of persons is accompanied by accompanying measures. There is also the possibility of invoking the valve clause to protect the Swiss labor market. Looking at labor market developments, the following conclusions can be drawn about the free movement of persons:  Immigration has been in line with the existing labor force potential; the Swiss labor force has not been increasingly forced into inactivity ; and wage developments have been stable and balanced in recent years. Why we should not jeopardize this positive aspect is presented below: Why must the self-determination and dismissal initiatives be rejected? Termination Initiative: With the so-called termination initiative, the SVP wants to eliminate the free movement of persons and thus the Bilateral I agreements. The Swiss population must now decide what is more important to them: controlling immigration or the prosperity of the country and thus also that of each individual citizen. This is because Switzerland would also be giving up access to the EU's internal market, which is central to our economy, with the free movement of persons. One look at the UK is enough to see the damaging effects such an initiative would have: even a much weightier country like the UK is not in a position to dictate its wishes to the EU. Rather, there is a slowly growing realization in the UK that it will rather be the EU that formulates the terms of the Brexit. So how would the much smaller Switzerland fare?! Self-determination initiative: The popular initiative ""Swiss law instead of foreign judges"" wants to write the primacy of Swiss law over international law into the constitution. This harmful initiative must be clearly rejected for the following reasons: If this initiative were to be adopted, Switzerland would unnecessarily seal itself off from the rest of the world. The initiative jeopardizes legal certainty and undermines Switzerland's credibility as a reliable contractual partner. This would put Switzerland on the international sidelines and render it incapable of acting, since no other state would be willing to conclude a treaty with Switzerland. Obligations under international law that Switzerland has entered into, which were not subject to referendum and which conflict with our constitution, would have to be renegotiated or even terminated if necessary. Switzerland would thus become a treaty breaker. The Swiss economy is dependent on the global economy, and an intact business law is therefore indispensable for Switzerland as a business location. The initiative therefore harms not only the economy, but also our prosperity. There is a threat of a weakening of internationally valid human rights in Switzerland. The initiative is a major attack on our legal system. In particular, our fundamental rights, legal security, stability and prosperity in Switzerland would be at risk. The BDP wants a Switzerland that does not isolate itself unnecessarily and can continue to influence its destiny as a reliable contractual partner, and whose economy, in interaction with the global economy, secures and expands our prosperity. Initiatives that grossly disregard these values must be rejected. Why does Switzerland need a framework agreement with the EU? The president of the BDP Switzerland correctly put it this way in 2018: "" (...) Switzerland [lies] in the heart of Europe. Switzerland is a European country even as a non-member of the European Union. That is geography! - Therefore, the question is not whether we want to have a relationship with the European Union or not; the only question is how this relationship should be structured. Because you can't have ""no relationship""..."" and further: "" (...) that the bilateral path is not simply a collected work of treaties, but must rather be understood as a concept. As a concept of our relationship with the European Union. This is because the bilateral path needs a conceptual framework, a strategic umbrella. There are many indications that the European Union is also strongly interested. And if it wants to negotiate a framework agreement with us, that is nothing other than the will to build a conceptual roof over the bilateral path with us. - What, please, can be so dangerous about this intention...?"" All bilateral agreements are based on intergovernmental cooperation; each state is therefore responsible for implementing the agreements in its own country (with the exception of aviation). The agreements with the EU are based either on equivalence of legislation or on the adoption of the EU acquis. These agreements are administered through Joint Committees in which both parties have equal rights. In case of disagreement, both parties shall decide by unanimity. The Joint Committees mainly decide on amendments of a technical nature. The agreements are not subject to automatic change. In the case of contracts based on equivalence, it is in the interest of both parties that equivalence can be maintained even in the event of legal developments. The follow-up of further developments is necessary to be able to guarantee a level playing field. Since 2014, Switzerland has been negotiating an institutional framework agreement with the EU, which should enable further development of the bilateral route and new market access agreements. The Framework Agreement seeks to achieve more uniform and efficient application of existing and future contracts in the market access area. FACTSHEET: For a credible, stable and responsible economic policy YES to real and effective solutions Switzerland as a business location and its successful model are facing difficult challenges. The BDP is willing to make its contribution to constructive, sensible and specific solutions and therefore adopted a position paper in the spring session. But it will not offer a hand when it comes to abusing the strength of the franc opportunistically for political purposes. The strength of the Swiss franc is not a new phenomenon, but a constant companion of the Swiss economy. And despite a consistently strong currency, Switzerland is one of the world's most successful export nations. However, there is nothing to sugarcoat here, because it is precisely surprising and strong price distortions that confront the affected companies and industries with extremely difficult tasks, and none of this will be painless. Switzerland, once a stable and secure investment location, has become unpredictable for many. Economic forecasts therefore had to be revised downward, as did the federal government's fiscal outlook. YES to the Bilateral Way Switzerland's economic ties with Europe are strong and of great importance for Switzerland as an exporting country. Around 60 percent of our exports go to the EU and 80 percent of imports come from the EU. That is why the continuation of the Bilateral Way is central to our economy, our jobs and our prosperity. The BDP wants to prevent a termination of the bilateral agreements as a result of the implementation of the mass immigration initiative or other political requests. It goes without saying that the will of the people must be implemented - without, however, completely isolating Switzerland from the European economy. For this reason, the BDP has submitted a parliamentary initiative. This demands that, in parallel with the Federal Council's negotiations with the EU and the domestic legislative process, the constitutional anchoring of contractual relations with the EU be prepared and presented to the sovereign in due course. The BDP takes the concerns of the Swiss people regarding immigration seriously and has called for the consistent promotion of domestic labor potential and the combating of abuses in the free movement of persons as key measures. Exploiting Swiss workforce potential In order to address the shortage of skilled workers and reduce the need for foreign labor, the BDP wants to make better use of the domestic labor potential. For years, the BDP has repeatedly called for the shortage of skilled workers to be alleviated with domestic labor and for labor market opportunities for the over-50s and for working women and to be improved. Here, the BDP is primarily committed to improving the compatibility of family and career - namely through the unbureaucratic expansion of daycare places and the introduction of day schools and block times. In order to facilitate the return to work after the family phase, the BDP proposes a familiarization allowance. In addition, a consistent education offensive is needed in the natural sciences and technology as well as in the healthcare sector. Education policy must be clearly geared to the demand for labor. Liberal economic policy and a clean financial center Switzerland's success model is based on liberal framework conditions that encourage companies to take responsibility for themselves. The state provides clear, fair rules and framework conditions without hampering the economy with unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles. Especially for the backbone of the Swiss economy, the SMEs, overregulation is harmful and costly. The BDP therefore consistently calls for a reduction in the administrative burden. But companies must also act responsibly themselves - excesses in wage policy or disregard for international rules damage their image and undermine citizens' trust in business. The BDP is calling for targeted measures instead of actionism in order to alleviate the recent franc shock: A targeted temporary VAT exemption for tourism and gastronomy would make sense, a special contribution for the promotion of innovation and the adjustment of exchange rate effects in procurement. The BDP initiated a forward strategy for the Swiss financial center early on, stating that a credible and competitive financial center can only define itself through tax conformity and compliance with international rules of the game. Unlike other bourgeois parties, the BDP focuses on sustainable solutions and not on backward-looking strategies. In addition to the introduction of the automatic exchange of information, the BDP supports the current reform of the withholding tax and the abolition of the stamp duty. Finances and taxes A successful economic policy starts with sound public finances, because debt is tomorrow's tax. The BDP will continue to advocate a sustainable budget policy that takes into account the requirements of the debt brake. Unnecessary expenditures must be reduced so that more funds can be spent on future-oriented projects: In the areas of education, research, environment, energy or transport. On the revenue side, there must be sufficient room for maneuver to continue to play in the top league in international tax competition - this is central for the Swiss economy as a whole. The BDP will lobby in parliament for rapid and consistent implementation of the Corporate Tax Reform III in order to preserve the attractiveness of the location and the tax base. For reasons of efficiency and administrative simplification, the BDP also calls for the creation of a standard VAT rate. Energy policy The BDP was the first conservative party to call for an orderly phase-out of nuclear energy. After all, ecological responsibility is not only a duty to future generations, but also offers great economic opportunities with above-average innovation potential. With numerous initiatives, the BDP has left a lasting mark on the energy debate in parliament and initiated the energy turnaround. The BDP is actively committed to an orderly nuclear phase-out and the consistent promotion of renewable resources and technological innovations. In a second phase starting in 2020, the current subsidy system must be gradually replaced by budget-neutral and, if possible, fiscal-quota-neutral incentive levies. A supporting pillar of the Swiss economy The financial center is one of the central sectors of the Swiss economy. Internationally, Swiss banks are among the flagships of our country. Domestically, they are an extremely important partner for companies, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. And - last, but not least - Swiss banks are essential providers of training and education positions as well as welcome purchasers of products and services. Economic policy principles of the BDP The basis for growth and prosperity is action based on personal responsibility and a willingness to perform. The export economy and the financial center must be strengthened by expanding and securing internationally secured rules and agreements. SMEs must be protected from further administrative and tax burdens. Liberal and modern framework Like the economy as a whole, the financial center needs liberal and modern framework conditions. This requires access to international skilled workers as well as access to international markets. The BDP is therefore committed to regulated and stable relations with foreign countries, in particular to the stabilization of bilateral relations with the European Union. In Germany, for example, the focus is on modern working time regulations and competitive framework conditions in the area of taxes and duties. Competitive financial center The BDP welcomes and supports the efforts to create a competitive and fiscally compliant financial center. The credibility associated with this ""white money strategy"" is a long-term success factor. Bank-client confidentiality is intended to protect the economic privacy of citizens, both domestic and foreign. But it must not at the same time enable the systematic and repeated evasion of substantial assets. Similarly, international competitiveness requires compliance with binding international rules of the game. The BDP was therefore the first conservative party to support the introduction of an automatic exchange of information with foreign countries (AEOI). Contemporary and binding regulations An internationally competitive financial center requires strong and internationally recognized financial market supervision. This includes a clear separation between financial market policy and operational supervisory activities. The BDP has been at the forefront of efforts to optimize organization and governance in this regard, which has since been taken up by the Federal Council. Likewise, BDP supports the desire for innovative technological solutions that also lead to facilitation of the increasingly comprehensive compliance mandates in the regulatory area. Optimal use of modern technologies in regulation enables efficiency gains for both companies and authorities. Sustainable financial center The Paris Climate Agreement points to the central importance of investment and financial flows in achieving climate goals. A sustainable financial center opens up both ecological and economic opportunities here. The European Union, for example, is working at full speed on the corresponding framework conditions. And the German government has already officially communicated that Germany wants to become a leading location for 'Sustainable Finance'. The Swiss financial center would be well advised not to miss out on strategic positioning here. This is not least due to the growing realization that the inclusion of climate risks is part of the fiduciary duty of care of pension funds and institutional investors. The BDP is committed to creating the appropriate framework conditions and making the necessary adjustments to laws and guidelines that enable and promote future-oriented investment. And the same applies to the possible dismantling of regulations that hinder this. This is also in line with the industry's wishes, which the Swiss Bankers Association reiterated in a position paper in September 2019. FACTSHEET: For a progressive and modern transport infrastructure Functioning and well-developed transport and infrastructure systems are central to our country's economy and society. As economic engines, urban centers depend on well-developed national and international connections. At the same time, transport networks and infrastructures also serve to connect peripheral regions and thus ensure the cohesion of the entire country. The BDP is committed to this and to the progress of Switzerland without ideological blinkers. The rail and road modes of transport must work together and not against each other, with the necessary weight being attached to the aspect of financing. In times of scarce funds, expansions based on the watering-can principle are not expedient. Instead, the really sensible and necessary projects and the maintenance of existing networks should be realized. For efficiency and financing reasons, consumer financing will play a more important role in the future. The BDP is open in principle to new financing methods such as public-private partnerships, road pricing or higher ticket prices, with the resulting revenue flowing back into investments in the mode of transport concerned. Transport financing: progressive solutions instead of ideology Functioning transport systems are of great importance for economic and cultural development. The high level of mobility in Switzerland is a fact of life, which is why transportation systems are now reaching their limits, especially in agglomerations and cities. Quality of life of residents and commuters as well as the economy suffer, and only an efficient transport infrastructure enables economic growth and jobs. The existing bottlenecks must therefore be eliminated as a matter of priority where the pressure of suffering is highest. The expansion must be approached in an ideology-free manner, without systematically disadvantaging any one mode of transport. Public and individual transport complement each other - a sensible coexistence must be the goal. For example, it makes no sense for the BDP to forego the expansion of neuralgic main road traffic axes (e.g. A1 Bern-Zurich or bypasses in the conurbation area) for ideological reasons. At the same time, the expansion of public transport within cities and agglomerations is more target-oriented. In the financing of transport projects, the watering can principle must be abandoned and more reliance placed on the consumer principle. Users should contribute more to the costs, also to create incentives to at least question their own mobility more. Because one thing is clear: our high mobility rate leads to a strong demand for transport services, the costs of which have to be borne to a large extent by the general public - especially in the case of passenger rail transport. The BDP does not want to restrict mobility per se, but it does want to get the incentives right and strengthen the consumer principle. In matters of financing for transport projects, the BDP therefore proposes the following measures:  Strengthening the consumer principle: selectively higher ticket prices in rail transport and/or demand-based tariffs in rail transport, a moderate increase in the freeway vignette and the examination of road pricing on certain traffic sections (e.g. inner cities or tunnels) are viable ways for the BDP to achieve more user-based financing. Ensure earmarking of the funds: On the one hand, the BDP wants to strengthen the consumer principle, but at the same time it also wants the revenue from user charges to flow back into investments in the mode of transport concerned. For the BDP, for example, a staggered increase in the mineral oil tax is only an option if the money is earmarked for road transport projects. Examine and incorporate public-private partnership models in new transportation projects (especially road transportation). Road infrastructure: Implementing overdue bottleneck elimination measures The BDP wants to implement the long overdue bottleneck elimination measures quickly. This mainly affects road sections in agglomerations and certain highway sections. These roads have long since reached their capacity limits - further delays in expansion must be avoided for economic and social reasons. For ideological reasons, the roads have been neglected by politicians for too long, even though a well-developed road transport infrastructure is a key success factor for Switzerland as a whole. In order to put the financing of projects on a secure footing, the BDP welcomes the creation of the NAF as a ""counterpart"" to the Rail Infrastructure Fund (FABI). The BDP calls for the following measures in the area of road traffic: Rapid realization of road projects to eliminate bottlenecks, namely in conurbations and on certain highway sections (A1 Bern-Zurich, Lausanne-Geneva). Continuation of the maintenance of the substance of main roads in mountainous and peripheral regions Creation of a fund for national road and agglomeration traffic (NAF) to ensure sustainable financing for the expansion of road infrastructure: In this context, the BDP considers a staggered increase in the mineral oil tax and the complete earmarking of the automobile tax to be correct. However, the network decision must be integrated as a whole into the NAF proposal. Construction of a second Gotthard road tunnel for the rehabilitation of the existing tunnel: For the BDP, the construction of the second Gotthard road tunnel without capacity expansion is a safety and economic necessity. The BDP already advocated the construction of a second Gotthard tube without capacity expansion in September 2010 with motion 10.3779. The Federal Council and Parliament are also in favor of this rehabilitation solution for the Gotthard. The construction of the rehabilitation tunnel ensures the connection of the Ticino and shows the best cost-benefit ratio for the BDP. In the future, it will not be a matter of expanding the north-south axis, but of increasing safety thanks to directional separation. Rail infrastructure: focus on core projects and maintenance Quantum leaps have been achieved in rail transport over the last 25 years. The BDP considers a well-developed rail network in Switzerland to be very important and welcomes in particular the expansion of the suburban rail systems in cities and conurbations as well as the intercity connections. Fully occupied trains show that demand is present or even too high. Nevertheless, the BDP does not want to continue blindly expanding the rail network in the future, but to focus more on core projects. This is not least because every expansion also results in massively higher maintenance costs. The BDP demands a clear calculation of these costs and a prioritization of important expansion projects according to the cost-benefit principle. In terms of financing, the aim in future must be to gradually increase the level of self-financing by rail users, which is currently around 50%. In rail freight transport, the BDP also sees a need for action by granting freight trains better rights of passage and no longer slowing them down to the same extent by passenger traffic. Rail freight can only be competitive if standing and travel times are reduced and sufficient rolling stock is available. The BDP demands the following measures in the area of rail transport: Clear calculation of maintenance costs in expansion projects Prioritization of important expansion projects Greater consideration of the consumer principle through higher rail prices and demand-based tariffs Better conditions for freight traffic: Shorter idle and travel times for freight trains and better consideration of freight traffic in expansion projects. Air and sea transport: Ensure international connections for passenger and freight hubs Modern transport systems ensure the country's international connections. The three main airports of Geneva, Basel and Zurich fulfill important functions as hubs for international air traffic for Switzerland as a business location. Of importance in this context is the Air Transport Agreement (ATA) with the EU under the Bilateral Agreements. The FVO has brought Swiss airlines access to the liberalized European market. Around 70 - 80% of aircraft movements at Swiss airports are between Switzerland and EU member states. Swiss airlines, as well as airports, maintenance and manufacturing companies, air traffic control and passengers benefit greatly from this. This is another reason why the BDP is committed to fighting for the continuation of the bilateral agreements with the EU. In shipping, the logistical services of the Rhine ports (container transports) are particularly important. The BDP calls for the following measures in this area: Preservation of stable and good framework conditions for the air and shipping industry, namely the preservation of the bilateral agreements with the EU. Position paper on health policy The development of costs in the healthcare sector has been a constant source of concern for Swiss politicians for years: costs have been rising continuously since 2000, and in 2015 spending for the total population was 77.8 billion Swiss francs. This cost growth can be attributed to demographic developments - a steadily growing population that is getting older and older - advances in medical technology, and volume growth. If we take our eyes off the costs and focus on the healthcare system as a whole, the following observations can be made: The healthcare system in Switzerland is good overall, both in terms of quality, availability for all and geographical distribution. The population's basic satisfaction with the healthcare system is regularly underpinned by surveys. Such a top-level health care system, which is available at all times and which is not divided into two classes, has its price. However, this price is becoming more and more of a problem the longer it goes on: more and more people in Switzerland are reaching their financial limits because of the constantly rising costs. All political actors are aware that something has to change. The question, however, is how. The solutions mentioned by various parties often differ enormously. In principle, the question arises as to where to start: with the benefits catalog? In terms of quality? With the availability? This raises another fundamental question: does the healthcare system need more government or more competition? And what role does federalism play in this? In the following, the BDP presents its solution-oriented, civic positions on healthcare: We want good quality and secure health care to which everyone has access. In addition to physical functioning, the term health encompasses activity and participation in the environment and fellow human beings. The claim of an interdisciplinary, holistic approach is derived from this definition. The view of the WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability or Health (ICF) is based on a three-dimensional concept of this functioning. The focus of the respective treatment should therefore be on maintaining or restoring these biopsychosocial functions or, in the case of chronic limitations, adapting to them. All residents of our country should have access to basic health care services. This is an important pillar of justice and social as well as political stability. Family medicine must be significantly strengthened. The coordinated treatment of patients/patients must be promoted. In their central role as gatekeepers, primary care physicians (general practitioners, internists, pediatricians, general practitioners) coordinate collaboration with specialists, hospitals, nurses and other healthcare professionals. This position optimizes the entire treatment chain and enables high-quality and cost-effective diagnostics and therapy. But for this chain of treatment to work, there needs to be enough primary care physicians. In recent years, there has been a marked decline in primary care physicians, especially in rural areas. The federal government is called upon more than ever to prevent this unfavorable development for the health care of the population. The following measures are to be taken: Refrain from further restricting the practice infrastructure (maintain practice laboratory with appropriate tariff, X-ray, ECG, self-dispensation where available) Realization of the long-promised correction of Tarmed in favor of family physicians Replacement of the numerus clausus by an examination of competencies relevant to the profession and an increase in annual diplomas Creation of family physician ordinariates at all medical faculties and closer networking with practicing physicians, Incentive systems (at cantonal and municipal level) for independent individual or group practices, especially in peripheral regions Risk equalization among health insurers has been refined in recent years. This has stopped the nonsensical competition for ""good risks"". Competition between insurers in other areas, on the other hand, should be encouraged. This is very useful when playing in the following areas: Which insurer controls providers' bills most efficiently? Which insurer has the most efficient administration? Which insurer handles customers best (e.g., advice)? Such competition ultimately benefits the policyholder in particular. The financing of care in homes and Spitex should be identical. In order for patients to be able to choose between inpatient care and care at home, the range of Spitex services must be further improved and expanded. In particular, the following measures must be introduced: 24h care must also be possible at home. On the one hand, palliative care must be anchored in the mission statement; on the other hand, further training on this important topic must be offered more frequently to enable patients who wish to die at home to do so. Electronic networking between hospitals, homes, Spitex and doctors must be improved. (admission/discharge) Equal treatment of Spitex and inpatient stays by health insurers is needed. The Confederation is obliged to present a solution regarding MiGeL: In 2018, the Federal Administrative Court ruled that means and objects for care (MiGeL) are no longer covered separately by health insurers, but by the residual financiers (often the cantons). For homes as well as for Spitex, this decision means a considerable additional financial burden, which ultimately also affects the patients. The obligation to contract should be abolished under certain conditions (quality criteria) and freedom of contract introduced. Restriction: ensuring regional supply. The highest maxim is quality. Competition must take place under clearly controlled conditions. A loss of quality in favor of lower prices must be prevented. The principle must be: Best quality at reasonable prices. In the same vein, coordinated treatment and gatekeeper models are supported. Maintaining local and social accessibility to the health care system is very important. This also means that responsibility for regional care must remain with the cantons despite the abolition of the obligation to contract under the constitution. This task cannot be delegated to health insurers. If regional coverage and quality are ensured, the contracting requirement can be abolished. It is imperative that communication between providers, and thus patient safety, be improved. Therefore, the introduction of electronic patient files needs to be accelerated. Today, a patient is usually treated primarily by a general practitioner, who also documents the course of the corresponding case. If necessary, the patient is referred to a specialist or hospital. Today, it is too often the case that examinations are carried out twice, thus unnecessarily increasing the cost of illness. At the national level, the legal basis for the electronic patient dossier came into force in 2017, which is intended to promote networking between partners. This legal basis must now be implemented quickly. However, it is imperative that networking and the associated sharing of patient data be subject to strictly formulated data protection and privacy criteria. In cutting-edge medicine, the cantons are challenged. Clear decisions have to be made within the framework of the newly created concordat. It has been clearly proven that centers which perform many cutting-edge medical interventions are in a much better position economically, but also, and above all, in terms of quality in the medical field. It is therefore incomprehensible that we afford too many small and thus too expensive units in cutting-edge medicine. Action must also be taken in Switzerland in the interest of patients. Patients' personal responsibility must be strengthened, either through integrated care models or by effectively increasing the deductible as well as the co-payment. Patient ownership must be increased. It makes sense and is justified that the insured not only benefit from solidarity, but also assume their share of responsibility in a concrete and tangible way. Coordinated treatment models (integrated care) can make a contribution to this. The Swiss electorate overwhelmingly rejected the managed care bill in 2012. Nevertheless, integrated care is on the rise, with two-thirds of insureds now opting for limited physician choice. Insureds with managed care models have to accept certain restrictions, but benefit from lower premiums and higher quality assurance. These models are to develop freely through the supply of insurers and service providers on the one hand and the demand of the insured on the other. Another way to strengthen personal responsibility is to noticeably increase the deductible as well as the retention. Higher deductibles should be bearable, because the premium burden decreases at the same time. A higher deductible will increase awareness of what medical services cost and that one may not / cannot use them ""just like that"" at will. Those on the lowest incomes and those on social assistance are given unrestricted access to health care through premium reductions and through social assistance. More and more people are now unable to pay their premiums. For this reason, appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that access to health care remains possible without restrictions for those on lower incomes and social welfare recipients (no ""two-tier medicine""). The KVG must remain an insurance law. All attempts to use this law increasingly for social policy and social politics should be rejected. The introduction of monism, the uniform financing of inpatient and outpatient treatment, must be pushed. Outpatient treatment should be preferred to inpatient treatment whenever possible. Today, the costs of hospitalization are shared between the cantons and insurers, but the costs of outpatient treatment are borne entirely by premium payers. Today, hospital treatments are also financed differently depending on whether they are performed on an outpatient or inpatient basis. This is unfair and must be changed. Premium payers, and thus capitation premiums, are overburdened under the system now in place. Also, this system leads to disincentives. The introduction of monism must now be pushed urgently: In the future, the health insurance funds would cover all costs, but the cantons would contribute at least 25.5%. The advantages of uniform financing of services are obvious: the shift from inpatient to outpatient care is promoted. Cost growth is slowed because outpatient services are less expensive. Premiums rise less quickly because the cantonal contribution also applies to outpatient services. This also makes coordinated care more interesting for the insured (see point 10). The switch to uniform financing ensures that the tax-financed and premium-financed financing shares of OKP benefits are stabilized. Uniform financing will encourage insurers and cantons to work more towards appropriate pricing of outpatient and inpatient services. Making the most of digitization! Modern means of communication are to be increasingly used. The cost trend in the healthcare system must be countered with efficiency improvements in all areas. Modern means of communication such as telemedicine should also contribute to this. Contemporary doctor-patient communication tools enable savings in time and travel, as well as unnecessary doctor visits. Compulsory vaccination, if necessary. In the case of diseases that are spreading again due to poor vaccination coverage or which are being introduced, compulsory vaccination can be an effective means. For example, Switzerland has set itself the goal of eliminating measles. Unfortunately, the number of cases of infected persons has increased again recently. Increasing the vaccination coverage of the population must be achieved through coercion if necessary. Because getting vaccinated is not a decision that you make just for yourself, but for everyone else. In order to prevent the pathogen from spreading and to establish so-called herd immunity, 95% of the population must be vaccinated. It would also make sense to introduce mandatory influenza vaccination for all physicians as well as nursing staff, especially in hospitals. To encourage patient ownership, a financial ""entry threshold"" is worth considering. Easy access to medical care at any time also has its downsides: Hospitals as well as general practitioners are overloaded with so-called emergencies, often at off-peak or night times, which are not emergencies at all. However, physicians are still required to perform examinations. Expensive and unnecessary tests are a burden on the healthcare system. A symbolic entry fee, payable for emergency visits to hospital/doctor's office made independently, could counteract the trend. FACTSHEET: Gender Equality: An Economic Necessity Equal pay for equal work On Feb. 28, 2018, the Council of States referred the Federal Gender Equality Act back to its relevant committee. With this law, the Federal Council aims to improve wage equality between men and women. Employers with more than 50 employees (according to the preliminary advisory committee of the Council of States only from 100 employees) should be obliged to carry out wage analyses in their companies every 4 years. The Council of States' action is disconcerting; BDP Council of States member Werner Luginbühl comments: ""We live in 2018, and the time when men argued with the divine order is now almost fifty years behind us."" The BDP has been fighting for the empowerment of women in the labor market since its founding. This includes equal pay, which is enshrined in the constitution. That this demand is well-founded and without doubt long overdue is shown by the following figures from the Federal Office for Gender Equality: in macroeconomic terms, women earn on average 1412 Fr. per month less than men. 58% of this wage difference is based on explainable reasons. 42%, or an average of 599 Fr. per month, cannot be explained by objective factors. The 599 Fr. that women earn less per month on average must be called wage discrimination. Women in management positions also earn up to 24% less than men. In contrast to other bourgeois parties, which sent the federal law on gender equality back to the commission and thus engaged in delaying tactics, the BDP is facing up to its responsibility and is actively campaigning for a better position for women in the world of work. The BDP has already advocated for improvements through other avenues as well. In doing so, it rejects left-wing recipes such as wage police or unrealistic quotas and focuses on bourgeois approaches to solutions. However, doing nothing is not a solution either, which is why minimal government measures in the form of incentives or increased transparency and reporting requirements cannot be avoided. Strengthening women's organizations in the social partnership In order to strengthen the position of women in the world of work, the BDP is calling in a motion for the Federal Council to enact provisions ensuring the institutional inclusion of women's organizations in the social partnerships. The interests of working women are underrepresented in the social partnerships: In addition to wage inequalities, the BDP is particularly offended by the lack of framework conditions for working parents and the underrepresentation of women in management positions. Encouraging working women could also help reduce immigration. However, empowering women in the world of work can only succeed if they themselves are included in the discourse of the social partnerships. Empowering women in the workforce - good for the national economy Strengthening the position of women in the world of work is of great importance to the national economy: for years, rightly, there have been complaints in Switzerland about a shortage of skilled workers. One measure to counter this would be to make better use of the domestic labor potential (the Federal Council as well as parliament have approved a motion by the BDP calling for legal changes to promote domestic labor). Another measure proposed by the BDP was a so-called familiarization allowance for returning to work after a family phase. Mothers in particular, who have given up their professional activities for a certain period of time in favor of the family, are often at a disadvantage when starting a career. The aim is to help women regain a foothold in the labor market - which ultimately also benefits the economy and the aforementioned shortage of skilled workers. Unfortunately, Parliament did not recognize the potential of this proposed measure and therefore rejected it. Better compatibility of family and career The national economy suffers great damage if well-educated women, in whose training a lot of money has been invested, stay away from the world of work. That is why the BDP is committed to enabling women to work. For years, the BDP has therefore been striving to improve the compatibility of family and career: An unbureaucratic expansion of daycare places, the introduction of day schools and block times are among its demands. It is important that women do not have to choose between family and career, but that the framework conditions are designed in such a way that mothers can remain in the work process. The BDP's proposals would make it easier for mothers to pursue their careers during the day, which would benefit the national economy enormously. Companies under obligation In addition to improved framework conditions - including part-time models for men - companies in particular have an obligation: they must show a willingness to make appropriate use of the female workforce potential. The percentage of women in management positions is still far too low, even though it has been proven that mixed teams have a high performance. Companies are called upon to hire and promote female specialists and managers and also to pay them according to their qualifications. Climate policy / Revision of the CO2 Act after 2020 The BDP demands the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement by means of a strong CO2 law and it also supports the Glacier Initiative. Climate change is a fact - it is up to today's politicians to assume their responsibility towards future generations and to take effective measures. The earth's surface has been warming at an extraordinary rate since the middle of the 20th century. This change in the Earth's energy balance is mainly caused by the emission of greenhouse gases. The consequences of climate change associated with rapid warming include rising sea levels, shifts in climate zones and habitats, and stronger and more frequent weather extremes such as storms, floods, and droughts. Switzerland, an Alpine country, is affected by global warming to an above-average extent. While the average global temperature has risen by 0.85° Celsius since the middle of the 20th century, in Switzerland it has been around 1.9°. If the temperature were to rise by 3° worldwide, this could mean an increase of 6° for Switzerland (which would be the same temperature difference as during the last ice age). Research predicts that as a result of this development, glaciers will have largely disappeared by the end of the century, resulting in serious changes for the water balance. The frequency and severity of extreme weather events will increase. In view of this development, Switzerland has a particular interest in ensuring that the global community makes a rapid and comprehensive transition to a CO2-neutral economy and way of life. That is why the BDP is clearly behind the Paris climate agreement, which calls for global warming of 1.5 to a maximum of 2 degrees Celsius. She is disappointed with what the National Council has done with the CO2 law, which was supposed to translate the results of the Paris Agreement into concrete law. The BDP is now counting on a clear correction by the Council of States. Climate change is a fact and it is now necessary to set the course for a rapid and significant reduction of CO2 emissions through decisive action in order to achieve a containment of global warming. The BDP therefore advocates: the more ambitious target of a maximum warming of 1.5 degrees. A binding domestic target that strengthens Switzerland as a business location: It is right and important that Switzerland is committed to climate protection both at home and abroad. A binding domestic target provides investment security, strengthens the local economy and helps us equip our infrastructures for the future. Following the Paris climate targets, the BDP supports a domestic reduction target of at least 40%. Foreign measures, in turn, can promote the export of Swiss technologies. Optimal reduction incentives through an increase in the CO2 tax: The CO2 tax has proven itself as a market-based instrument and is therefore a first-choice climate policy tool. Thanks to the CO2 tax, building emissions have fallen by 20% in the last 10 years. The Federal Council's proposal to increase the levy rate to a maximum of CHF 210 if interim targets are not met is therefore important. There is great potential for efficiency in the building stock: Renovations save energy costs and increase living comfort. In the building sector, however, there is still a great deal of untapped efficiency potential. The BDP supports a combination of efficiency targets and the continuation of the building program until 2030. An efficiency target should be made mandatory and introduced at an early stage. At the same time, there needs to be a realistic efficiency threshold (20kg of CO2 per m² of building area, which is reduced by five kilograms every 10 years). In this context, the BDP parliamentary group submitted a motion in the March 2019 session calling for consistent promotion of the energy-saving contracting model. On the one hand, the market is to be stimulated by pilot projects, and on the other hand, the federally owned companies are to be made responsible in this area. Cantons and municipalities are to be supported in the implementation of energy-saving contracting, and the federal government is also to show how the energy-saving contracting model is to be accounted for in the public sector. In the transport sector, progress in reduction efforts is particularly important: road transport is the largest source of emissions domestically. In reality, the problem should be tackled with an incentive tax on fuels. At present, there does not seem to be a majority in favor of this. Fleet targets at least provide incentives to switch to more efficient engines and help accelerate the breakthrough of electromobility. The important thing here is that the lowering of the limits for new cars takes place in step with the EU. With the compensation obligation for importers of fossil fuels, car importers do not contribute directly to the decarbonization of the transport sector, but they do contribute to climate protection at home. Here, the BDP supports a domestic offset of 20% on average for the years 2021-2030 (with a cap on the maximum fuel surcharge at 12 centimes per liter of fuel). Energy performance contracting - what is it? In energy-saving contracting, the provider takes over the financing in addition to the classic services. The costs are then refinanced through the annual energy cost savings. For the building owner, this opens up a valuable source of financing, thanks to which he can exploit energy-saving potential in the first place. Transparency in the area of climate risks in the financial sector as a minimum standard: The Swiss financial sector contributes to the global emission of around 1000 million tons of CO2 annually. That is about 20 times as much as is produced domestically. Although the financial center thus has a powerful climate lever at its disposal, the CO2 bill does not contain any provisions in this regard. Many countries are already further along in this regard, for example, with regard to the transparency of climate risks in the financial sector. The BDP therefore supports transparency rules that help to advance the gradual phase-out of shareholdings in fossil fuel companies. An airline ticket levy as the order of the day: Air travel is currently tax-exempt, as there is neither a kerosene tax nor a value-added tax. However, international air traffic accounts for about 5% of Swiss emissions and is on a strong upward trend. All surrounding countries have already introduced an airline ticket levy. It therefore makes sense to introduce such a levy in Switzerland as well. Climate innovations thanks to the strengthening of Switzerland as a location for research and innovation: The implementation of the Paris climate targets will only succeed thanks to innovation and new technologies. Good framework conditions play a decisive role in determining whether Switzerland contributes to the development of solutions or has to buy them in later. Instruments in this area need to be strengthened. The BDP supports the glacier initiative The Glacier Initiative essentially wants to eliminate fossil fuels from 2050. After the unacceptable watering down of the CO2 law, the BDP had initially planned its own popular initiative, which would have aimed for innovative mobility without new registrations of combustion engines from 2030. The Glacier Initiative is broader and more comprehensive in this regard, but also provides more time. Because the BDP has never launched an initiative for electoral reasons, but always pursues a solution-oriented policy, it has decided not to launch its own initiative. Instead, it wants to join forces and actively support the Glacier Initiative. Position paper BDP Switzerland Education Status 11.01.2014 The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that every child has the right to education, care and upbringing. The Swiss Federal Constitution also states in various articles that children and young people must be supported and encouraged in their development. The BDP stands by this and devotes special attention to education. In particular, the BDP's education policy focuses on the following priorities: Training and quality of teachers Performance-oriented and high-quality education system Cooperation between school and parents/guardians Early holistic support Parent education Offer day structures Equal opportunities Dual education system Integration Intercantonal harmonization of curricula High-quality school materials that are as uniform as possible Competence orientation according to Curriculum 21 Permeable educational offer at upper secondary level Promotion of STEM subjects Lifelong learning The educational landscape has changed significantly in recent years. It attempts to provide answers to today's demands. The BDP Switzerland is convinced that much is good, but there are still some tasks to tackle. Shortage of skilled workers, adaptation of vocational schools to the competencies of school leavers, vocational apprenticeships also for weaker students and dealing with foreign students in technical colleges and universities, to mention some of the challenges. The BDP is open-minded towards new knowledge in education and supports additional educational paths that open up due to new communication technologies. Thus, this position paper is to be understood as a snapshot. Equal opportunities and performance-based education The BDP Switzerland is aware that Switzerland occupies a top position in international comparison with regard to vocational and higher education as well as research. To keep it that way, the school system must remain agile and challenging. We are committed to a performance-oriented and high-quality education system that provides equal opportunities for all. Education and a willingness to perform are the basis for securing prosperity for future generations. We are convinced that the quality of education and training centers depends on the quality of teaching and thus primarily on the quality of the teacher. Only secondarily do structures play a role. The BDP therefore attaches great importance to the training and continuing education of pedagogical professionals. Teachers and school principals deserve recognition and must be supported in their daily work with good working conditions. At the same time, however, the BDP is also aware of the importance of cooperation in the school sector, in particular of parents and parent participation. Good cooperation between the educational institution and the parents or guardians is essential. Furthermore, the BDP calls for and promotes the coordinated optimization of training paths through good networking of training institutions at the tertiary level. In the Swiss educational landscape, the ""dual education system"" is a successful model that is considered a role model against massive youth unemployment even in the international arena. Two-thirds of Swiss young people (as of 2012) complete a vocational apprenticeship. The BDP Switzerland sees this as one of the most important pillars of the Swiss education system and therefore advocates a qualitative expansion of the dual education system. In this context, permeable training programs that enable diverse educational and professional careers are important. Early promotion and day structures Early intervention supports children's ability and willingness to discover and learn from their world. Early support is not understood to mean training as early as possible, but early support in a holistic sense. The family is fundamentally an important place for early support. It should be able to take advantage of various support options. We distinguish between four different types of educational support: Self-initiative: Children need children. In addition to contact within one's own family, contact with other children is also central as early educational stimulation and to promote the social component. The BDP would like to motivate families to participate in family meetings on a voluntary basis and to attend recreational activities for children (MuKi/VaKi gymnastics, playgrounds, children's museum days, playgroups, etc). Parent education: A special focus belongs to parent education. Parents bear the responsibility and should be aware of it. The BDP considers it useful for parents (including parents of young children) to have access to information and counseling services through newsletters, workshops, and information sessions. General: The BDP advocates for the retention and promotion of counseling centers, which can be used by parents. Many contact and advice centers are already available at the municipal and cantonal level. Furthermore, offers for day structures must become a matter of course. Specific: Children with special needs should be provided with special support. The BDP supports inclusive education, but also sees its limitations. The optimal support must therefore be clarified on an individual basis. Good framework conditions for families and children must be created, especially if a family cannot comprehensively ensure healthy development on its own. Resources within the family must be strengthened. Day structures Day structures must be offered to ensure lunch and off-hour care. They are an element in offering parents the opportunity to combine work and family life. In addition, day structures create a reliable framework for children who are hardly cared for by their parents outside of school hours. This is thus a significant contribution to the equality of opportunity that the BDP strives for. Day structures are also increasingly an important location factor for municipalities. The BDP Switzerland demands a qualitatively and quantitatively sufficient offer of care and support. The school has an obligation to provide differentiated support for children. All children and young people should be able to develop their talents, develop their skills and achieve a suitable educational and vocational qualification. Care and early support should primarily benefit children, but also parents, the economy and the state, and should be jointly financed. The earned income of the parents must be taken into account. The services should be accessible to all families, regardless of where they live or their socioeconomic circumstances. Preschool and elementary school The BDP Switzerland is interested in a high quality of elementary school. For this purpose, the school has to adapt itself in an adequate way to permanently new social needs without getting bogged down. Differentiation efforts in the school sector, the consideration of the children's level of development and the joy of learning are to be supported; school structures are of secondary importance. Integrative school The BDP is committed to the integrative approach, which requires differentiated support. As a basis for support, instruments must be provided that can be used to measure students' learning progress. The guiding principle ""Integration yes - but not at any price"" must be taken into account. If the expense exceeds the benefit of integration, other solutions must be found, because integration must be fair to both the child and the school. Integration is a high priority for the BDP. Harmonization and Curriculum 21 We demand a nationwide prioritization of teaching objectives and teaching content in the curricula, as well as harmonization and competency orientation in accordance with Curriculum 21. Language barriers must be overcome. In addition, the BDP Switzerland demands a nationwide uniform school entry. Our request is that we support further measures to break up federalism in this regard. This is necessary if we want to take into account the mobility of families and the demand for equivalent competencies throughout Switzerland, especially with regard to vocational training and university studies. A uniform level is also a prerequisite for being able to better compare services with one another. The concept of education and competence orientation are important, correct and meaningful. Among the cross-curricular topics, we particularly welcome the inclusion of ""ICT and media"". In the STEM area, we make sure that technology is also included to a sufficient extent. In order to fundamentally stimulate interest in STEM lessons, sufficient space must be given to experiential learning. The BDP is convinced that Curriculum 21 can be used for all school models and school levels. In our view, however, implementation can only succeed if the quality of teaching materials and teacher training keep pace accordingly. We are committed to ensuring that publishers of teaching materials work together more closely and that the quality of teachers' training is guaranteed. Quality of teaching The quality of education or training centers depends on the quality of teaching and thus on the quality of the teacher. That is why teacher training is a top priority for the BDP Switzerland. The pedagogical cooperation within the teaching staff, the effect of the school management as well as the interaction between system requirements and self-design have a great influence on the quality of teaching and performance. The BDP Switzerland therefore calls for training for teachers and school administrators that enables them to implement the following priorities in practice: Consensus on goals: Establishing a consensus among teachers on educational goals and ideas about the development of students' personalities. Own Schoolhouse Culture: Recognize and cultivate the importance of a good school and learning climate, classroom atmosphere, and work and learning satisfaction for all involved in the school. Performance Expectations: Make clear demands of students and of themselves. Assist students with their learning and provide intensive feedback. Cooperation: Participate in important decision-making processes and maintain good cooperation with each other as well as with school management, authorities and parents/guardians. Leadership: The school management is interested in pedagogical development, leads and supports the teaching staff. It creates good conditions for innovation or optimization processes. Furthermore, it encourages participation and co-decision-making and makes the necessary decisions in the event of problems that cannot be solved jointly. In the future, school administrators should take more responsibility for the learning successes at their schools. Evaluation: Teachers reflect and review their teaching. They reflect on the educational and instructional goals they have set for themselves and their school in a self-evaluation. Instructional reflection: use instructional reflection as a prerequisite for instructional development, rather than falling into the ""experience trap."" Support service: The teaching staff as well as the school management shall support teachers especially during their professional introduction phase. In the continuing education of teachers, team courses for entire school departments or comparable groups should be increasingly conducted and supplemented by individual continuing education opportunities. The BDP Switzerland also calls for periodic external evaluation of schools to ensure quality assurance of educational institutions. Secondary school I The secondary level I focuses on an optimal transition from elementary school to vocational training or a secondary school. Great importance must be attached to the cooperation between the parental home and the receiving institutions. The dialogue between elementary and vocational, respectively secondary schools must be strengthened. Secondary level II Two-thirds of young people in Switzerland (as of 2012) complete a vocational apprenticeship, which is why particular attention must be paid to the dual education system. The latter is still considered a successful model and is regarded internationally as a model solution to massive youth unemployment. The BDP Switzerland therefore calls for continued strong support and qualitative expansion of the dual education system. It also promotes and demands training opportunities for young people who do not reach the school level for a vocational apprenticeship (internships, attest training, etc.). In special cases, young people in apprenticeship need special support or supervision that none of the three parties (parents, training company and vocational school) can provide. Such complementary supports are to be encouraged. The BDP Switzerland supports the measures for school leavers who cannot directly enter vocational training (motivation semesters, internships and interim solutions) in order to continue to keep youth unemployment at a very low level by international standards or to further reduce it. The BDP supports and promotes performance-based high school education. The transfer from the various school levels to the Gymnasium and the permeability between secondary schools, specialized secondary schools and vocational secondary schools are a quality feature that must be taken care of. With a wide range of baccalaureate degrees, permeability between upper secondary and tertiary levels is ensured. The BDP does not want quotas but high quality high schools. Our prosperity is a reflection of our permeable educational offerings at the upper secondary level. We intend to continue paying close attention to this. Tertiary Education In order to promote and maintain Switzerland as a location for innovation and research, the BDP Switzerland attaches just as much importance to the tertiary level with its universities, universities of applied sciences and higher technical colleges as it does to the dual education system. University graduates with doctorates or master's degrees are the specialists and innovators in all academic performance disciplines. The two types of higher education institutions, university and university of applied sciences / university of teacher education, must not be played off against each other. They should be equal, but not the same. Specifically, it aims to bridge the gap between academic and vocational education. An investment in universities and a strengthening of higher vocational education with differentiated training and access are equally important. Enable closing access For talented and educationally interested vocational graduates, the BDP Switzerland demands that they be given the unhindered opportunity to complete a higher technical examination or, after completing the vocational baccalaureate, a university of applied sciences degree, in order to close the important practice-based and academically sound professional gap between a university degree and vocational training. In this sense, the universities of applied sciences must be taken care of. Practical and academically interested high school graduates are to be given the opportunity to study at a university of applied sciences via a one-year internship. Highly talented graduates from universities of applied sciences should be given the opportunity to complete a master's degree and then go on to earn a doctorate at a university. In view of the rapid development of modern communication technologies at universities of applied sciences and universities, the BDP is open to new teaching and instruction models. Promotion of STEM subjects Since there is currently a shortage of graduates in mathematics, engineering, natural sciences and technology, the BDP Switzerland is devoting special attention to these fields of study at the tertiary level, the so-called MINT subjects. The shortage of qualified specialists in STEM as well as in the health sector must be counteracted. In particular, in order to take account of demographic developments and alleviate the shortage of skilled workers, appropriate measures must be initiated and implemented. Quaternary formation In view of the fast-moving times, the BDP considers it an important prerequisite that people's education can keep up with the changing times, respectively with the rapid technical progress and the general new challenges. This requires continuous training and lifelong learning. Even in our own workplace, situations and professions are changing. It is important to take account of these changes at an early stage on one's own initiative and to undergo further training or retraining accordingly. In this regard, employers must also be held responsible by initiating appropriate information and courses. The BDP is committed to continuous professional development. This also includes senior education. The objective of the BDP is to enable people to cope independently in everyday life for as long as possible, despite constant changes, and to face new achievements with confidence. Management structure The BDP Switzerland supports a strong local school and a system with political, strategic leadership by the municipal authority and operational leadership by the school management. The two management bodies must work together constructively. However, a polarizing concentration of power in the school sector must be prevented. This requires a clear division of responsibilities between strategic and operational management. In this regard, the BDP is reviewing the tasks, performance workloads and management structures and will make demands if necessary. We are convinced that the school needs a strong lobby: political, strategic leadership (municipal authority): The BDP Switzerland supports a militia system that focuses on the strategic leadership of the school and acts as a strong lobby for the school locally. The municipal management body focuses exclusively on school matters and thus keeps the school management's back free for its diverse tasks in operational management. Operational management (school management): The BDP Switzerland supports the system of school management, which performs the operational management of the school holistically. Clear responsibilities and relationships are to be created, which can also be used for quality management. Funding and research Education is our most important asset. It requires sufficient, targeted resources. The BDP Switzerland calls for increased effectiveness reviews of investment activities in the education sector. Accordingly, it calls for an expansion of educational research at the national level. Research and practice must work together even better. This collaboration provides valuable insight into effective instructional development. Summary The BDP stands behind the Swiss education system. It demands and promotes constant, targeted and qualitative further development. We are aware that education is Switzerland's raw material, and we must take care of it. Civic Democratic Party of Switzerland P.O. Box 119, 3000 Bern 6 Tel. +41 (0)31 352 14 82, Fax +41 (0)31 352 14 71 mail@bdp.info, www.bdp.info Cybersecurity position paper Digitization is advancing at a rapid pace: it is affecting society, the economy and politics alike. In addition to the many opportunities it opens up, it also presents us with enormous challenges: As a result of the shift of criminal activities - but also of state activities vis-à-vis other states - into cyberspace, its security is increasingly becoming the focus of politics and the public. The BDP, as the party of progress, has for years championed the tools of the future, information and communication technologies. As a party of reason, however, it is also aware of the risks of the same and is therefore committed to the security of our cyberspace. It therefore proposes the following measures: Security in cyberspace - a global problem The worldwide advance of digitization opens up perspectives for networking society and the economy that were thought to be impossible until a few decades ago. The flip side of the ""the world is becoming a village phenomenon"" is the illegal use of the same. As well as the positive effects, digitization is also creating negative effects of unprecedented proportions. Thus, the illegal use of digital technologies is and will be one of the great challenges of the 21st century. Cyber space is increasingly being abused for criminal, power-political, and intelligence purposes. Attacks via digital networks on infrastructures such as power supply and telecommunications can destabilize a country. Digitization therefore does not stop at the borders of a state. As a global development, it is changing international politics and creating new foreign and security policy challenges. In particular, the forms of conflict and the instruments used to resolve them have changed with digitization. Due to technological developments, cyberspace is a completely new field in which conflicts can be settled. However, these new instruments merely supplement the traditional means of resolving conflicts. Until a few years ago, the security focus had been primarily on criminal actors. However, little was known about the pursuit of state interests via cyber attacks, and the military use of cyber weapons is also a relatively new phenomenon: the first secure attack of this kind took place in 2011. The threat of cyberattacks comes from various actors: The spectrum ranges from individual perpetrators, professionally organized hacker groups and criminal gangs to military and intelligence hacker squads. The greatest source of danger today is considered to be professional and governmental hacker teams that conduct (industrial) espionage or attack critical infrastructures. The illegal use of cyberspace is based primarily on the fact that no other space offers better opportunities to cover one's own tracks of (illegal) activity. Attribution of activities, especially aggressive ones, therefore remains difficult, if not impossible. Another feature of the illegal use of digital technologies is the blurring of the lines between civilian and military; even state hackers hardly differ from ""ordinary"" cybercriminals in the technical means they use. Importantly, the legal principle of territoriality fails, especially for digital data when it is processed and stored globally, detached from its real-world origins. Instead, we must speak of a shared space. Cyberspace is not a homogeneous, clearly delimited legal space. For this reason, cyberspace must not be perceived as a traditional, security policy space. Another distinctive feature of cyberspace is the blurring of offense and defense. For military and intelligence actors in particular, the motto is now that penetrating foreign computer systems and analyzing their vulnerabilities does not yet constitute an attack in the classic sense. And finally, terrorists also play around in cyberspace: They (still) use it primarily for propaganda purposes. Nevertheless, secure communication channels on the Internet are used for planning attacks or controlling terrorist cells. ""With cyberspace, man has for the first time created a (virtual) space for himself and is now using it for his conflicts. Security in cyberspace is a fundamental interest of state provision, but the classical enforcement mechanisms from the real world largely fail."" The still unsolved problem of this man-made space is the transfer of principles of international law from analog to digital space and their enforcement. To be sure, more than 70 countries have formulated cybersecurity strategies, in addition to agreements at the supranational level. However, there is a lack of initiatives at the international level, for example, for rules and good conduct by states on the Net. 1 http://www.bpb.de/apuz/235533/sicherheit-im-cyberspace?p=all, as of 8.10.18 The BDP therefore calls for Switzerland to be more active at the international level in advocating clear rules for state action in cyberspace. As explained above, this virtual space is subject to other laws. Nevertheless, it must be ensured that our principles of international law are also applied in this area; Switzerland, as a small country, is dependent on this. Cybersecurity in Switzerland Although the problem of cybersecurity is primarily an international one - virtual space is not interested in principles such as state sovereignty or territoriality - measures must also be taken at the national level to ensure the greatest possible security. Switzerland has done a lot in recent years to improve the security of cyberspace. The 2012 National Strategy for the Protection of Switzerland against Cyber Risks aims to localize potential threats, reduce cyber risks and increase the resilience of critical infrastructures. Not only was a risk and vulnerability analysis prepared, investments are to be made in research and development, and a crisis management system is to be created. In 2018, the Federal Council approved the further development of this national strategy, which was jointly prepared by the federal government, the business community and universities. The defined measures now range from capacity building and knowledge, to cooperation in cyber law enforcement, to cyber defense measures by the military and intelligence community. Based on this National Strategy, so-called minimum standards for information and communication risks in Swiss companies have been developed in collaboration with the business community in 2018. Over one hundred specific action items are designed to help companies improve their resilience to cyber risks. The Reporting and Analysis Center for Information Assurance (MELANI) is an important element in the defense system. Here, cyber risks are to be identified at an early stage and the operators of important infrastructures are to be supported. The Army, as a potential target, focuses primarily on protecting its own infrastructures. It also produced a Cyber Defence Action Plan to be implemented by 2020. Since 2018, the Army has also had a so-called cyber RS: it is to use cyber specialists to protect military data centers and communication systems from attacks from 2020. Furthermore, the Federal Council is striving for a competence center for cyber security and the creation of a Federal Council committee on cyber security. Despite these measures, the BDP still recognizes gaps that need to be closed in order for Switzerland and its infrastructure to receive the best possible protection against cyberattacks. Therefore, the BDP demands that : the population should be made more aware of the problem of cybercrime. the Information Security Act is passed. Every day, the federal government deals with large amounts of data and information that must be protected. An information security law creates minimum security requirements, which all authorities must subsequently fulfill. a legal obligation to report security-relevant events is introduced. Operators of critical infrastructures should be required to report cyber incidents to the authorities. at MELANI, capacities for early warning of and support in the event of serious cyber attacks should be expanded. Binding minimum standards are installed for critical sectors (for example, in the energy sector). the federal government promotes cybersecurity training at universities - because the federal government in particular needs well-trained experts. Security in cyberspace -also for Swiss companies The topic of cyber security does not only concern critical infrastructures or the army; the economy is also affected by this issue. And it's not just the large, international companies; SMEs are also increasingly becoming the focus of cybercriminals. They are attracted to places where they can get a lot with relatively little effort - i.e. Swiss SMEs. The focus is on those who do not address security issues and do not take appropriate defensive measures. Criminal activities range from extortion to data theft, espionage, and sabotage. According to a 2017 survey of Swiss SMEs, an estimated 40% of SMEs are affected by cyberattacks. So, as in the analog world, entrepreneurs need to think about how they want to protect their companies. However, many entrepreneurs are unable to respond appropriately to the threats; in many cases, they lack the knowledge. It often takes very little to noticeably improve the security of an SME. For example, by checking the safety precautions at regular intervals. Or by creating an individual security concept that is appropriate for the company. The buzzword when it comes to cybersecurity in the Swiss economy is ""self-responsibility"". Every company is responsible for its own security - whether in the analog or digital world. Decentralized and heterogeneous systems are preferable to centralized (government) regulation. All the more so because not every company is at risk to the same extent. However, SMEs must not be left alone with this task: They need help to help themselves. Therefore, the BDP demands that: Swiss entrepreneurs be made aware of the risks in cyberspace. Swiss industry associations draw up the guidelines for dealing with cyber risks that are necessary for their industry. SMEs should also be able to benefit from the experience of large companies. Continuing education opportunities and consulting services on the topic of cybersecurity are available for SMEs. It remains to be said that SMEs are the backbone of our economy - and this must be protected from any criminal activity, not only in the analog but also in the digital space. Because ultimately, protecting our SMEs from cyber risks means protecting our jobs. Agricultural policy - performance should be rewarded! In the near future (as of fall 2018), Switzerland will face a number of agricultural policy proposals. The BDP would like to take this opportunity to show Switzerland that it also has a reasonable and future-oriented position in this topic area, which does not play off the farmers against the export-oriented economy! In a first step, the BDP will comment on current agricultural policy proposals in this paper; in a second part, it will comment on the future of agriculture in Switzerland. The position of the BDP on current proposals ""Drinking Water Initiative: The popular initiative ""For clean drinking water and healthy food - No subsidies for the use of pesticides and prophylactic antibiotics"" demands that only those farmers who do not use pesticides or prophylactic antibiotics and who only keep as many animals as they can feed without importing feed should be supported with direct payments. The BDP's position is as follows: If the initiative is accepted, food production in Switzerland would be severely restricted. Organic food production would also be affected by this initiative, since according to the list of aids, non-synthetically produced pesticides are also allowed in organic farming. This would increase dependence on imports. Therefore, the BDP rejects the initiative. It must also be noted that the prophylactic administration of antibiotics is already prohibited in Switzerland. Also, the use of plant protection products is not subsidized in Switzerland. The BDP believes that all groups involved - not just farmers! - have to make their contribution to clean waters. Farmers today are already committed to clean waters and sustainably produced food. In addition, Switzerland would have to import massively more foodstuffs if the initiative were to be accepted, but the formulated requirements would not apply to them. ""For a Switzerland without synthetic pesticides"": The initiative aims to ban the use of synthetic pesticides in the production and processing of agricultural products. Also, only food produced without synthetic pesticides should be allowed to enter Switzerland. Here, too, the BDP states that the project is laudable, but again, as with the drinking water initiative, it must be noted that the initiative text makes demands contrary to any proportionality and must therefore be rejected. Because the drastic consequences if the initiative is adopted are likely to be as follows: Not only would agriculture's room for maneuver be massively restricted, but the quality of food, especially with regard to hygiene requirements, would also suffer. In addition, Switzerland would have to reckon with a significant reduction in domestic production. The offer would decrease as well as the variety of the same. It should also be noted that the topic of ""synthetic pesticides"" should not only focus on farmers, but also on hobby gardeners, who often virtually flood their gardens with pesticides. ""Mercosur: Federal Councillor Schneider-Ammann is seeking a free trade agreement with the Mercosur states (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay). The Swiss economy supports such an agreement: It hopes for a great potential for exports as well as no competitive disadvantage for Swiss companies (because the EU is also striving for a free trade agreement with the Mercosur states). The Swiss Farmers' Union opposes such an agreement. He fears a dismantling of border protection and with it the cheap products from South America. He criticizes that the Federal Council in its overall view of the end of 2017 does not present any solutions for how an opening of the border could compensate for the feared large losses of farmers. The BDP is in favor of a free trade agreement with the Mercosur countries because it supports a strong Swiss export economy. But it also supports a producing Swiss agriculture. It recognizes the difficult position that such an agreement could put farmers in on the agricultural market. Therefore, she pleads for an agreement, but with the inclusion of the interests of farmers. Therefore, accompanying measures must be taken to this agreement, which cushion the production disadvantages of Swiss agriculture that are tied to the location. ""Free Trade Agreements with Southeast Asian Countries."" A free trade agreement with Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries is also about to be concluded. The reactions to this are the same as for ""Mercosur"". The business community is in favor of an agreement, while the farmers' association is against it. With one difference: Together with the Farmers' Union, Swiss environmental, human rights and consumer organizations are resisting the inclusion of palm oil in the agreement. Palm oil cultivation in Indonesia and Malaysia leads to massive environmental damage as well as human rights, land and labor conflicts. In addition, the farmers' association also warns here of the negative financial impact on farmers if cheap palm oil is imported and thus displaces Swiss rapeseed and sunflower oil. As with ""Mercosur,"" the BDP favors a compromise between the interests of business and the concerns of farmers. The parties concerned must not be played off against each other. However, the BDP is clearly against the inclusion of palm oil in the agreement and thus takes the concerns of civil society seriously. With regard to the popular initiatives, the BDP recognizes the laudable intentions of the initiators, but it must point out that the demands are too extreme and thus do not represent any added value for Switzerland. Therefore, they should all be rejected. The agricultural policy of the future Since its foundation, the BDP has positioned itself as a party of reason and compromise. It therefore generally rejects political ideas that are too extreme or only conducive to populism. Instead, it is actively looking for solutions with majority support that will effectively benefit Switzerland, its population and also its economy. Therefore, it presents below its demands to the Swiss agricultural policy, so that it can offer in the future a good framework for agriculture, in which the farmers can practice their profession again gladly, well and above all profitably. The demands are deliberately formulated as guidelines, thus on the one hand creating a framework for the future shaping of agricultural policy, and on the other hand leaving enough room for innovative and creative ideas without creating intellectual barriers. Swiss agriculture will face major challenges in the coming years. Increasing (low-cost) competition from abroad is making life more and more difficult for farmers, and numerous structural problems at home are also leading to a situation in which more and more farmers are having to fight for their survival. In addition, the current model of direct payments is difficult in its formal design, and many farmers feel overwhelmed by the bureaucratic hurdles. The BDP is aware of the difficult situation of Swiss farmers, but nevertheless concludes that the solution to the problem cannot be a (renewed) redesign of agricultural policy. Instead, it advocates - in the form of a general objective for Swiss agricultural policy - an optimization of the path taken to date. With the following guidelines, the BDP formulates its demands for the Swiss agricultural policy of the future: The BDP demands that farmers be supported in their core competence, the production of healthy food. In 2017, the Swiss electorate voted in favor of ensuring food security in Switzerland. The safeguarding of the basis for agricultural production is thus more clearly anchored in the constitution: In addition to safeguarding the basis for production, the location-adapted and resource-efficient production of foodstuffs is stipulated. In order for Swiss farmers to adequately fulfill this constitutional mandate, they need the support of politicians. Farmers today face a variety of challenges that limit them in their core competency of producing food. Initial measures to reduce these challenges are proposed as follows: a simplification and reduction of the administrative burden for farmers. A stable political framework instead of fundamental reforms every few years. The position of producers in the value chain must be strengthened. The BDP demands that performance should once again be rewarded. A fundamental idea of our modern, enlightened society, especially the market economy, is the principle of performance: Those who perform should be rewarded. However, this principle does not apply to the current structure of Swiss agriculture: Every day, three farms have to close in Switzerland (as of 2017). Smaller and conventional farms are particularly affected. Many farmers pursue a sideline because they cannot live from farming alone. Swiss farmers receive less and less money for some products, for example milk: Milk production is very costly, but the price farmers receive for it hardly covers the costs. With their work, Swiss farmers make an essential contribution - now even formulated as a constitutional mandate - to our supply. This service is not adequately compensated, which must change. For example, through measures in the following areas: The promotionof the farmer as an entrepreneur The restructuring of the value chain The promotion of Swiss products and producers: Thepromotion of sales of regional, healthy and high-quality agricultural products The BDP demands that the production disadvantages caused by an expensive environment, difficult topographical conditions and a high density of regulations be compensated. Swiss products are more expensive than foreign ones. This is due, among other things, to the production disadvantages to which Swiss farmers are exposed. As a result of increasing free trade with the expected dismantling of border protection, Swiss products - despite their initial disadvantages - must increasingly compete with foreign products. These starting disadvantages must be compensated for in an appropriate manner so that competition can proceed fairly. The BDP does not reject the idea of competition - as long as the starting conditions do not take the participants out of the race before it even begins. The BDP demands that public services be adequately compensated. The core competence of farmers is the production of food. Nevertheless, they make a valuable and indispensable contribution by means of public services. Today, these public services are compensated with the general and ecological direct payments. Farms in mountain regions in particular make an important contribution with their services, for example, to maintaining the quality of the landscape. These public services will become even more important in the future, the higher the demands on environmental protection or animal welfare, for example. The BDP calls for the federal government to provide greater support for innovation, marketing and the development of sales channels in agriculture. The federal government requires farmers to increase their exposure to the market - and thus to competition (both domestic and foreign). To this end, it seeks to dismantle border protection in the course of negotiations on free trade agreements for the sake of overall economic interests. As already explained, the BDP does not oppose these fundamental thrusts per se. However, various measures must be taken (as outlined above) to ensure that Swiss agriculture has a - livable - future. An important approach is the promotion of entrepreneurial ""tools"": Prospective farmers must be increasingly trained in innovation, marketing and the development of sales channels during their basic education. Even after training, government support in these areas must increase greatly. The BDP demands that the social security of farmers be improved. In agricultural policy, there is a lot of talk about topics such as ""market"", ""competition"", ""resource efficiency"", etc.; however, what has hardly been addressed so far - and is of great importance to the BDP - is the social aspect in agriculture. There is a particular need for action in the area of economic, legal and social security for assisting spouses (especially farmers' wives). This is because a classic family model still prevails in agriculture, which, for example, makes it practically impossible for the spouse to share in the ownership of the property or, in the event of divorce, leads to a shocking disadvantage for the spouse who does not share in the property. For these reasons, the following measures are proposed: A general de-tabooing of the topic of social security for assisting spouses. Employee spouses must be given a better legal position (in particular, improvements are needed in the case of divorce). For example (ex)-spouses must be granted a right of first refusal to the business (even before the siblings). the calculation of the profit claim must be specified. Social security coverage for assisting spouses must be improved. Measures are also needed to diversify ""social"" operations. The BDP demands respect! Respect for the environment, climate and animals The referendums in recent years have shown that issues such as climate change, environmental protection and animal welfare have gained in relevance - also among the population. Switzerland must now face up to its responsibilities, especially in the area of climate change. The BDP stands by this responsibility and is therefore aware that agriculture must also make its contribution. The following measures are proposed by the BDP: Our environment must be protected, but in collaboration with farmers, and not at their expense. A consistent energy transition is needed in Switzerland - with the involvement of Swiss agriculture. Resource-efficient, locally appropriate and fairly produced food must be promoted. Animal welfare plays an important role in this. BDP solutions to the financial and economic policy challenges Switzerland as a business location and its successful model are facing difficult challenges. After about three years, the Swiss National Bank has abandoned its defense of the euro's lower limit of 1.20, and public finance forecasts have had to be revised downward in light of the economic outlook. In addition, there is great uncertainty regarding the implementation of the ""mass immigration initiative"" and thus the bilateral relationship with Europe. The threat of economic isolation, as well as musings on the meaning of international law and human rights, have weakened Switzerland's global image. Switzerland, once a stable and secure investment location, has become unpredictable for many. Solutions are required in this challenging environment. The BDP is willing to make its contribution to constructive, meaningful and specific solutions. However, it will not offer a hand when it comes to abusively and opportunistically exploiting challenges such as the strength of the Swiss franc for political purposes. It is not about the political goals of individual parties, but about the question of how the affected companies and industries can be helped in a targeted manner. The strength of the franc - don't gloss over it, don't dramatize it. After the Swiss National Bank defended the euro at the 1.20 mark for around three years, this lower limit was abandoned. After that, what had previously been delayed for around three years came to pass: The euro exchange rate fell again, and the strength of the Swiss franc became more pronounced. Criticism of the Swiss National Bank is out of place here. The BDP fully supports the independence of the National Bank. It was clear from the outset that the euro floor was a temporary measure, thanks primarily to which time could be gained. Structural preservation, on the other hand, is not a task of the Swiss National Bank. The strength of the Swiss franc is not a new phenomenon, but rather a constant companion of the Swiss economy. Even before the SNB's intervention phase, the euro had fallen from around 1.40 to below 1.10 against the Swiss franc in a (too) short period of time. And the development of the U.S. dollar against the Swiss franc has also experienced only one direction in recent decades. And despite a consistently strong currency, Switzerland is one of the world's most successful export nations. There is nothing to sugarcoat here, even if the challenges are not new per se and even if the SNB was able to postpone recent events for three years with its interventions. There is nothing to sugarcoat, above all, because it is precisely surprising and severe price distortions that confront the affected companies and industries with extremely difficult tasks, and none of this will be painless. The competitiveness of the export and tourism industry is significantly diminished by the strong franc, because costs in Switzerland as a business location are rising in relation to those abroad. Due to the high economic importance of these industries, Switzerland is threatened with growth losses, relocation of production abroad, higher unemployment figures and reduced tax revenues. Government support measures must therefore act quickly and specifically where they are needed. In the short term, the BDP sees potential primarily in financial and administrative simplifications: Temporary VAT exemption of tourism and gastronomy: The tourism and gastronomy sectors, which have been particularly hard hit by the crisis, must be given the opportunity to be exempted from VAT for a limited period upon request, in analogy to the mechanism of short-time work in the export industry. In this context, clear criteria must be defined that do not serve to maintain structures, but rather promote innovation. Likewise, the BDP will continue to advocate a uniform rate for VAT, as it promised after the vote on the ""Gastroinitiative"". As long as no uniform rate is introduced, at least a ""gastro-uniform rate"" should be realized. Consideration of exchange rate effects in procurement: Clear criteria are applied in today's tendering procedures. The fact that domestic providers are increasingly being competed against by foreign providers is fundamentally correct and enriches competition. However, in order to ensure a level playing field for all bidders, currency effects must not distort the comparability of bids. It is therefore appropriate to apply the effective purchasing power parity rather than the respective (volatile) exchange rate of the foreign exchange market for the comparability of the offers. More funding for regional policy: The funds for the new regional policy (NRP) must be increased. The BDP will support the corresponding proposal of the Federal Council for an increase in the amount of 200 million francs from the existing fund, which is likely to be expanded. Overall, these measures help to finance particularly innovative tourism projects, optimize the coordination of funds and stakeholders, and improve cooperation between hotel businesses. Strengthen CTI: Switzerland's international competitiveness is also characterized in particular by a high capacity for innovation. As a funding agency for innovations, the CTI supports this with financial resources, professional advice and the offer of networks. The BDP is willing to continue to strengthen the CTI for the benefit of a strong and innovative economy and to provide it with more resources. Simplify customs clearance: To this end, the motions already approved by Parliament must now be pushed through via an urgent procedure. In particular, this concerns measures on electronic customs procedures, flexible border crossing and the transition to the ad valorem customs system. (http://www.parlament.ch/d/suche/seiten/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20143011; http://www.parlament.ch/d/suche/seiten/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20143012; http://www.parlament.ch/d/suche/seiten/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20143013; http://www.parlament.ch/d/suche/seiten/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20143014;http://www.parlament.ch/d/suche/seiten/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20143015) It should be noted that in other contexts, the Federal Council and Parliament have already successfully brought about rapid solutions via the urgency procedure. If there is now to be a serious response to the strength of the franc, it will have to be quick. Therefore, urgent procedures and immediate measures are also needed for this. With unnecessary loss of time, these measures would miss their mark. Careful financial planning The worsened economic outlook has implications for the state budget. Impending tax shortfalls or declining tax revenues require sustainable cost-cutting measures. The leverage is clearly to be applied to the cost side and not to investments, which will be more necessary than ever in terms of countercyclical behavior. The BDP is therefore calling for the consolidation and task review package (KAP) to be implemented in subsequent years to the same extent as it was included by parliament in the 2015 budget. In addition, the BDP expects the Federal Council to undertake a strategic review of tasks in order to realize additional substantial relief. In view of the outlook, it can bear unnecessary tax losses in the public sector less than ever. The BDP is therefore pleased to note that both the ""family initiative"" and the ""energy instead of value added tax"" initiative were clearly rejected by the electorate. Improve framework conditions The BDP wants to defend and further develop the successful Swiss model at various levels. Improving the attractiveness of a location for existing and new companies requires business-friendly framework conditions and political stability. The BDP has therefore been quick to point out ways in which the uncertainty arising from the adoption of the ""mass immigration initiative"" can be shortened and, in particular, the relationship with Europe clarified. The BDP also wants to implement the popular will expressed on February 9, 2014 for lower immigration by consistently promoting domestic labor. This way, not only the bilateral contractual relationship with the European Union can be continued, but also a gigantic bureaucracy and the associated costs can be dispensed with. New or higher burdens for companies and private households must be prevented. The BDP will therefore reject and vehemently fight, for example, the ""Inheritance Tax Initiative"" and the ""Pro Service Public"" initiative. Rising bureaucracy is a reality that is making life increasingly difficult for companies. The causes, on the other hand, are manifold and sometimes difficult to discuss. The BDP sees this only partly in the legislative environment of the parliament. Often, exaggerated and incomprehensible hurdles are subsequently built in at the ordinance level and also in the scope for interpretation of implementation at the administrative level. The BDP is therefore calling for a motion to instruct the Federal Council to massively reduce the administrative burden within two years. To this end, all federal regulations are to be reviewed in an orderly and systematic process with regard to their scope and complexity and massively simplified. The target is to reduce the number of prescriptions by one third and the volume by at least half. In principle, directives, guidelines and directives should be completely abolished and only applied in justified exceptional cases. The BDP is also committed to the introduction of a right of veto for Federal Council ordinances. Parliament must have the certainty that what has been ""ordered"" at the legislative level will also be carried out at the ordinance level. Likewise, the BDP notes with concern that job growth in the administration is above average compared to the economy. Effective job growth in Switzerland in recent years has taken place exclusively in the healthcare sector and in administration. All other sectors show a downward trend. This means, in effect, that Switzerland is investing ""in itself"". Switzerland must be able to count short distances and lean processes - also in the administration - among its strengths and thus offer companies unbureaucratic framework conditions. From this perspective, the incentives to increase effectiveness in administration are too small. The question therefore arises as to whether lower personnel resources would not lead to process optimization. The BDP reserves the right to present concrete proposals and motions in due course. Drive strategic projects forward Those who are now trying to prevent strategically important projects with a long-term focus in order to supposedly combat the strength of the Swiss franc in the short term have not only lost their way on the timeline, but are opportunistically trying to torpedo unwelcome political dossiers. The BDP will do just the opposite and advocate for strategically important projects. These are more necessary than ever to restore Switzerland's competitiveness. This is how the innovation push from the energy turnaround is used. The BDP is committed to a consistent and business-friendly implementation of the energy transition and will continue to fight for an orderly nuclear phase-out and the promotion of renewable resources and technological innovations. It is convinced that the consistent implementation of the Energy Strategy 2050 is the best economic stimulus program for the domestic market. The surge in innovation triggered by the energy transition is opening up new economic opportunities. Swiss companies have new sales opportunities due to the demand for smart technologies and quality products in the energy sector. The move from a subsidy system to a steering system is to be completed by 2020 in order to consistently place the energy policy framework on a liberal and market-based footing. This energy steering system must be implemented in a budget-neutral manner and, as far as possible, with a neutral fiscal quota, as well as providing for cushioning measures for energy-intensive companies. Likewise, the Corporate Tax Reform III must be tackled and implemented swiftly. It increases competitiveness as well as planning security. The same is true for other projects that lead to equal footing. Various reforms in the financial center, for example, are not simply regulations, but an investment in Switzerland's competitiveness and credibility. They must be seen as an opportunity. There is no way around the recognition and implementation of global standards. It makes sense, however, to avoid unnecessary 'swiss finishes' and to plan implementation in step with the most important competitors."
